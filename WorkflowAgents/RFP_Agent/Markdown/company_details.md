## üíº Core Services

- **AI-First Automation**  
  We help companies streamline operations using AI agents, document processing, and GPT-powered assistants. Most solutions rely on LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) or NLP models for intelligent automation.

- **Backend Platform Engineering**  
  Custom APIs, logic engines, and microservices using Python (Django, FastAPI) and Node.js. We focus on building robust technical foundations; **we do not handle front-end UI/UX design** or native mobile development.

- **Cloud & DevOps**  
  Deployment via AWS and GCP with Docker, CI/CD, and basic infrastructure automation. We do not support hybrid on-prem/cloud deployments or manage Azure environments.

- **Lightweight System Integration**  
  API-based integration with modern tools like Salesforce, Slack, Google Workspace, and Mailchimp. **We do not perform direct SAP/Oracle customizations** or ERP system configuration.
