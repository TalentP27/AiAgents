Net-zero emissions

## CLEAN OPERATIONS FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION

Leader in sustainable aviation
DHL Express GoGreen Plus is a dedicated solution to help businesses reduce the carbon emissions associated with their shipments through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). GoGreen Plus uses SAF to enable customers to reduce the CO2e emissions associated with their shipments, and is currently supported by three of the industry's largest collaborations with BP, Neste and World Energy.

In contrast to 'offsetting' - where businesses 'neutralize' their emissions through environmental programs - GoGreen Plus is 'insetting'. Insetting's impact is greater because it directly reduces emissions within a company's value chain, resulting in significant reductions in scope 3 emissions. Here is how you can get on board:

- With the GoGreen Plus Basic model, a fixed CO2e reduction (insetting) will be achieved on all your air express shipments.
- In MyDHL*, you can opt for GoGreen Plus and choose which shipments to invest in with SAF.
- Alternatively, choose a Customized Offer for a bespoke insetting plan.

Green last-mile and line-haul
Electrify $\mathbf{6 0 \%}$ of last-mile delivery vehicles.

## Carbon neutral buildings

Design 100\% of all new buildings to be carbon neutral.

## Green product portfolio

Our GoGreen Plus service allows customers shipping TDI to inset their CO2 air emissions by up to $\mathbf{9 0 \%}$.

## GREAT COMPANY TO WORK FOR ALL

- 'Safety First' culture
- Diverse and inclusive workplace


## HIGHLY TRUSTED COMPANY

- Compliance as an integral part of daily business

## ENABLING YOUR GROWTH

We aim to empower our customers' success, not only through excellence and innovation, but also by arming them with research and insights. Discover two tools here that can help you plan for the future.

## ARE YOU CONNECTED?

To be successful in today's evolving world, it is crucial to understand trends around connectedness and globalization.

The latest edition of the DHL Global Connectedness Report 2024, released in partnership with New York University's Stern School of Business, revealed a remarkable finding: even in times marked by severe conflict, globalization reached a record high in 2022 and remained near that level in 2023.

## Globalization continues

- Despite recent crises, globalization shows no signs of reversing, due to the resilience and growth of international flows of trade, capital, information and people.
- Globalization has not given way to regionalization. Most international flows have taken place over stable or longer distances.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
- The world's current depth of global connectedness is only $25 \%$.
- There is still ample room for growth. The world's absolute level of globalization remains limited; domestic flows still far exceed international flows.

At shipper's request, the preparation or provision of a Certificate of Origin or other similar forms by DHL to certify the goods in a particular export shipment have been produced, manufactured or processed in a particular country allowing preferential rates of duty to be claimed at destination. When exporting from the U.S., this service is available only for goods made in the United States.
# SERVICE OFFERING 

## CUSTOM SERVICES

## Regulatory Charges

Fiscal charges raised by Customs authorities to complete the import or export of a shipment. Examples of a regulatory charge may include the express consignment fee that U.S. Customs \& Border Protection charges for customs clearance through express consignment carrier facilities.

## Single Clearance

Under 19 CFR 128 Express Consignments regulations, nonrestricted merchandise based on value and commodity can be cleared on a consolidated manifest for more cost- and time efficient processing. DHL will assess a service charge for the following clearance processing that require individual handling:

- When the importer requests a single formal entry if the shipment is qualified to be cleared informally on the manifest
- If U.S. Customs and Border Protection requires Live Entry
- If the commodity and country of origin require Antidumping/ Countervailing Duties at time of import


## View charges

## Temporary Import/Export

At a customer's request or when the document is missing from the shipment at origin, DHL will prepare an international Customs document, e.g. ATA Carnet, to simplify Customs procedures for the temporary import/export of various goods.
Photographic proof, written details or original receipts are often required to identify the goods. An importer can also import certain classes of goods into the U.S. duty-free by posting a bond, according to 19 CFR Part 10. The importer must complete and sign the DHL Temporary Importation under Bond (TIB) contract and processing procedures prior to preparing a TIB entry. A service charge will be assessed for any Temporary Import/Export services.

## Under Bond/Guarantee

A single-transaction bond is used in lieu of a continuous bond, in the event a customer is not bonded. A service charge will be assessed (minimum applies).

## DUTY BILLING SERVICES

## Duty Tax Paid

At Customer's request, DHL clears the shipment at destination and arranges for the applicable import duties, taxes and regulatory charges to be invoiced to a specified DHL account at origin or third country, rather than the receiver of the shipment being billed at destination. In addition to billing the specified DHL account for such duties, taxes or regulatory charges, DHL assesses on the duty tax payer an extra charge based on a flat rate or a percentage of the fiscal charges that were paid.

## Duty Processing formerly known as Duty Tax Importer

At Customer's request, DHL clears the shipment at destination and arranges for any applicable import duties, taxes and regulatory charges to be invoiced to a specified DHL account at destination. In addition to billing the specified DHL account for such duties, taxes and regulatory charges, DHL assesses on the duty tax payer an extra charge based on a flat rate or a percentage of the fiscal charges that were advanced.

## Duty Processing formerly known as Duty Tax Receiver

This default service covers any import of a non-document shipment for which DHL has used its own credit line with Customs to advance or guarantee the payment of duties, taxes or regulatory charges on behalf of receivers (importers and consumers) with whom DHL has no contract. In addition to billing the receiver for such duties, taxes or regulatory charges, DHL assesses on the receiver an extra charge based on a minimum rate or a percentage of the fiscal charges that were advanced or guaranteed.

The DHL Customs Services listings are available at mydhl.express.dhl/us/en/ship/customs-services.html and will be updated or supplemented from time to time. Customs Services will be billed in accordance with the DHL list of Optional Services, Surcharges \& Customs Services in effect at the time the shipment is tendered. DHL Optional Services, Surcharges \& Customs Services are in addition to applicable transportation charges.

## PREPARING YOUR SHIPMENT: AS EASY AS 1-2-3

1 Shipment weight

- Please weigh and measure your shipment.
- If you are sending a large but lightweight shipment, where its volumetric (dimensional) weight exceeds its actual weight, the cost of the shipment is calculated on the space your consignment takes up on the aircraft. This is a standard IATA method. To calculate the volumetric weight of your shipment, simply multiply the length by height by width in inches, then
- divide the total sum by 139 for each piece in the shipment.
- Any piece in the shipment may be re-weighed and/or re-measured by DHL to confirm this calculation.


## 2

## Documentation required: waybill

- All shipments sent with DHL Express need to have a fully completed DHL waybill or label securely attached to each piece. This will enable the successful movement of your shipment through the DHL network. Each waybill or label is individually numbered to allow you to track your shipment from collection through to delivery.
- Your shipment may also need to be accompanied by customs documentation, such as a commercial or proforma invoice, as well as additional paperwork depending on the contents and value of the shipment and the country you are sending to.


## 3

## Documentation required: invoice

- A commercial or proforma invoice is required when sending non-document shipments to countries and territories outside your origin country or customs union. This is essentially a declaration containing all the details of a transaction and is used by customs authorities to assess if duties or taxes are payable.
- A commercial invoice is used when goods are part of a commercial transaction or intended for resale.
- A proforma invoice is used when sending goods of no commercial value (for example, when sending samples).

## PACKAGING YOUR SHIPMENT

To ensure that your shipments travel safely and securely through the DHL Express global network, it is important that they are packaged and labeled correctly.

## Packaging guidelines

- If you are re-using envelopes or boxes, please ensure that old labels and markings are removed
- Securely fix a waybill to each piece in your shipment. The waybill can be thought of as the shipment's airline ticket and it will delay delivery if it becomes separated from your shipment
- The barcodes on the waybill are scanned at numerous points during your shipment's journey. Please ensure the barcode is flat and not covered by tape, shrinkwrap or strapping
- Place a waybill on the top or side of each piece in your shipment and please ensure it does not overlap the corners or edges of boxes
- Use adequate protective wrapping for fragile or delicate items and ensure they are packed as far away as possible from the corners of boxes
- To prevent injury to our employees, please pay special attention to the packaging of sharp items. There should not be any possibility of the contents piercing the packaging
- Any individual pieces over 70 kg should be placed on a pallet. If you are sending a multi-piece shipment, it is not necessary to place the individual pieces on a pallet unless they exceed 70kg. For example, a shipment comprising four 25 kg pieces does not have to be placed on a pallet
