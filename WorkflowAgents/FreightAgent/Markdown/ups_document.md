# Determine the Weight and Size UPS Express® and Expedited Services

## **Billable Weight: Actual or Dimensional?**

Determining which weight to use in calculating your rate requires that you determine which rule applies. Different rules apply depending on the service selected.

For UPS Express services, actual weight is the weight of the package rounded up to the next half kilogram for packages up to 20 kilograms, and to the next kilogram thereafter. For UPS Expedited, actual weight is the weight of the package rounded up to the next kilogram.

Dimensional weight considers density, which is the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight.

Billable weight is the weight used to calculate the rate. The billable weight will be the greater of the package's actual or dimensional weight.

### **Note:**

Packages that exceed UPS weight and size limit are not accepted for transportation. Contact our Customer Service Representatives for details.

In instances where the shipment's weight (either actual or dimensional) computed by the UPS billing system is greater than the weight declared by you, the UPS billing system will apply such computed weight as the billable weight to determine the applicable rate for billing purposes.

## **Irregularly-shaped Packages**

Measure boxes or containers that are not rectangular to determine dimensional weight and whether the package is within maximum limits.

Treat the irregularly-shaped package as if it is in a regular rectangular box. Measure the length, width and height of the package from its extreme points.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

### **Step 1**

Determine the Actual Weight: Use a scale to determine the weight of the package. For UPS Express services, increase fractions of a weight to the next half kilogram. For package 20 kilograms and above increase fractions of a weight to the next kilogram. For UPS Expedited, increase fractions of a weight to the next kilogram.

### **Step 2**

Determine the Dimensional Weight*: Calculate the cubic size by multiplying the length by the width and by the height (each rounded off to the nearest whole centimetre) of each package.

Divide the cubic size of the package by 5,000 to determine the dimensional weight in kilograms. For UPS Express services, increase fractions of a weight to the next half kilogram. For package 20 kilograms and above increase fractions of a weight to the next kilogram. For UPS Expedited, increase fractions of a weight to the next kilogram.

### **Step 3**

Select the Proper Zone: Locate the appropriate zone for the shipment in the zone chart on pages 9 to 12.

$$
\frac{\text{Dimensional Weight}}{\text{in Kilograms}} = \frac{L \times W \times H}{5,000}
$$

- $L$ = Length in centimetres
- $W$ = Width in centimetres
- $H$ = Height in centimetres

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

### **Step 4**

Determine the Shipment Weight: Rates for multiple-piece shipments**, which include UPS Express Paks and packages shipped to a single receiver on the same day, are based on the total shipment weight of an individual shipment. This means substantial savings over single-piece rates. To determine a shipment's total billable weight, use the greater of each package's actual or dimensional weight.

### **Additional Information: Weight and Size Limits**

- Maximum weight per package is 70 kg.
- Maximum length per package is 274 cm.
- Maximum size per package is 400 cm in length and girth [(2 x width) + (2 x height)] combined.
- There is no limit to the total shipment weight or number of packages in a shipment.

* For import shipments, use the origin country unit of measure and dimensional factor to calculate the dimensional weight.

Dimensional weight applies to all international shipments except shipments using UPS Express Envelope, UPS 10 KG Box® and UPS 25 KG Box®.

* Multiple-piece shipment refers to a shipment consisting of packages and/or documents sent via a single waybill number.

# Determine the Weight and Size UPS Worldwide Express Freight® Services

## **Billable Weight: Actual or Dimensional?**

Determining which weight to use in calculating your rate requires that you determine which rule applies.

Actual weight is the weight of the items on the pallet and the weight of the pallet rounded up to the next kilogram.

Dimensional weight considers pallet density, which is the amount of space a pallet occupies in relation to its actual weight.

Billable weight is the weight used to calculate the rate. The billable weight will be the greater of the pallet's actual or dimensional weight. A minimal rate may apply.

### **Note:**

In instances where the shipment's weight (either actual or dimensional) computed by the UPS billing system is greater than the weight declared by you, the UPS billing system will apply such computed weight as the billable weight to determine the applicable rate for billing purposes.

### **Step 1**

**Determine the Actual Weight:** Actual weight is the weight of the items on the pallet and the weight of the pallet rounded up to the next kilogram.

### **Step 2**

**Determine the Dimensional Weight\***:** Calculate the cubic size by multiplying the length by the width and by the height (each rounded off to the nearest whole centimetre) of each pallet.

Divide the cubic size of the pallet by 5,000 to determine the dimensional weight in kilograms. Increase fractions of a weight to the next kilogram.

$$
\frac{\text{Dimensional Weight}}{\text{in Kilograms}} = \frac{L \times W \times H}{5,000}
$$

- \( L \) = Length in centimetres
- \( W \) = Width in centimetres
- \( H \) = Height in centimetres

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

### **Step 3**

**Determine the Billable Weight:** Compare the pallet's actual weight to the dimensional weight. The greater of the two is the billable weight and should be used to calculate the rate.

For multiple-pallet shipments, add up each pallet's billable weight to determine the shipment's billable weight.

### **Billable Weight Calculation**

e.g., A customer has a shipment of three pallets weighing 50 kg, 400 kg and 300 kg. All pallets are the same size with the following dimensions: 122 cm x 102 cm x 150 cm

1. **Determine the Actual Weight**
   - Actual Weight: 50 kg + 400 kg + 300 kg = 750 kg

2. **Determine Dimensional Weight**
   - Pallet Dimensional Weight: (122 cm x 102 cm x 150 cm) / 5,000 = 373.5 kg
   - Shipment Dimensional Weight: 373.5 kg + 373.5 kg + 373.5 kg = 1,120.5 kg

3. **Determine Billable Weight**
   - Shipment's Billable Weight: 373.5 kg + 400 kg + 373.5 kg = 1,147 kg

**\*** For import shipments, use the origin country unit of measure and dimensional factor to calculate the dimensional weight.

## UPS FTZ Facilitator

This service is available for shipments using UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Freight Services, UPS Worldwide Express Saver and UPS Worldwide Expedited.

This contractual, fee-based service allows the shipment of goods to move to or from an FTZ without using other transportation providers. Using UPS as a single source enables importers and exporters to increase visibility and tracking, and reduce the chance for errors and costs associated with utilising multiple transportation providers.

Importers will choose UPS FTZ Facilitator to direct shipments to be delivered, in-bond, to a designated FTZ rather than being cleared through customs. The fee for this service is MYR280 per shipment.

Exporters will choose UPS FTZ Facilitator to ship goods in-bond from an FTZ to an international destination. The fee for this service is MYR280 per shipment.

Dry Ice must be packed in packagings designed and constructed to permit the release of Carbon Dioxide gas to prevent a buildup of pressure that could rupture the packagings. Prepare and process these packages through WorldShip ${ }^{\circledR}$ or UPS CampusShip ${ }^{\circledR}$ shipping systems, UPS Developer Kit or an approved UPS Ready ${ }^{\circledR}$ solution. For a detailed listing of countries that are able to import or export Dry Ice, please contact our Customer Service Representatives.

[^0]:    a The UPS 10 KG Box is designed to hold a maximum weight of 15 kg . The UPS 25 KG Box is designed to hold a maximum weight of 30 kg . It is not recommended that shipments sent in the respective boxes exceed the maximum weight limits.
    a In some instances, shipments may be more economically charged if rated at a higher billable weight than the actual billable weight ("Deficit Weight Billing", or "DWB"). The UPS billing system will compute both amounts using the gross shipping rates and take the lower of the two before applying any customised incentives to finalise the charges. DWB is applied by default. If you encounter any billing issues due to DWB and/or wish to opt out of DWB for actual billable weight of the shipment to be charged in all instances, please contact your sales representative.

[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{a}$ In some instances, shipments may be more economically charged if rated at a higher billable weight than the actual billable weight ("Deficit Weight Billing", or "DWB"). The UPS billing system will compute both amounts using the gross shipping rates and take the lower of the two before applying any customised incentives to finalise the charges. DWB is applied by default. If you encounter any billing issues due to DWB and/or wish to opt out of DWB for actual billable weight of the shipment to be charged in all instances, please contact your sales representative.

DWB is applied by default. If you encounter any billing issues due to DWB and/or wish to opt out of DWB for actual billable weight of the shipment to be charged in all instances, please contact your sales representative.
