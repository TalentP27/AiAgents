# How to calculate your rate 

See special rate instructions for FedEx SameDay ${ }^{\circledR}$ starting on p. 44. For information on FedEx One Rate ${ }^{\circledR}$ pricing, see p. 46. You can also view rates online, plus get FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ Retail Rates; go to fedex.com/ratetools/RateToolsMain.do?locale=en_US.

## Package services

1. Find the zone for your destination. For U.S. shipments, go to fedex.com/ratetools/RateToolsMain.do?locale=en_US, then enter your origin ZIP code to see which zone your destination ZIP code corresponds to. Or request zone location information by calling 1.800.463.3339.

Zone tables for U.S. export and U.S. import shipments start on p. 4. (See p. 11 for U.S.-to-Canada zones.)
2. Determine the chargeable weight. Determine the weight of the package (for international shipments, determine the weight of the total shipment). Then see Dimensional Weight on p. 135. Your chargeable weight is the greater of the actual weight or the dimensional weight.
A minimum billable weight may apply for shipments in FedEx packaging. See p. 139.
For more information on Multi-Piece Shipment weight calculations, see p. 140.
3. Find your rate. ${ }^{3}$ See the appropriate rate table, starting on p. 12 for U.S. shipments, p. 48 for international shipments, or p. 117 for FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments. Next, choose a FedEx service. Then find your chargeable weight from step 2 above to determine your rate.
A $\$ 5.95$ residential surcharge per package will be added to FedEx Home Delivery shipments.
For multiple-piece shipments, multiweight pricing may apply. See p. 42 (U.S. shipments), p. 80 (Puerto Rico shipments), or p. 80 and 114 (international shipments) for details.
4. Determine fees. See fees and other non-transportation charges that may apply starting on p. 124. For U.S. import shipments, call 1.800.463.3339 and say "international services" for service fees applicable from your origin country or territory.

## Express freight services ${ }^{3}$

1. Find the zone for your destination. For U.S. shipments, go to fedex.com/ratetools/RateToolsMain.do?locale=en_US, then enter your origin ZIP code to see which zone your destination ZIP code corresponds to. Or request zone location information by calling FedEx Express Freight Customer Service at 1.800.332.0807.

Zone tables for U.S. export and U.S. import shipments are on p. 9 (see p. 11 for U.S.-to-Canada zones).
2. Determine the chargeable weight. For U.S. shipments, first determine the actual weight of each freight handling unit. Round up to the next-higher pound. Second, calculate the dimensional weight of each freight handling unit. See Dimensional Weight on p. 135. Third, determine the chargeable weight for each freight handling unit: Your chargeable weight is the greater of the actual weight or the dimensional weight. Each freight handling unit is subject to a minimum billable weight of 151 lbs. regardless of its actual weight.
For FedEx International Priority ${ }^{\circledR}$ Freight, FedEx International Economy ${ }^{\circledR}$ Freight, and FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ International Deferred Freight shipments first determine the combined actual weight for all freight handling units. Second, calculate the dimensional weight for the entire shipment. See Dimensional Weight on p. 135. Third, determine the chargeable weight for the entire shipment: Your chargeable weight is the greater of the actual weight or the dimensional weight. The total shipment is subject to a minimum billable weight of 151 lbs. multiplied by the number of freight handling units.
For all express freight shipments, individual freight handling units typically weigh 151 lbs. or more. Freight handling units exceeding 2,200 lbs. require prior approval.
2. Find your rate. U.S. shipment rate tables are on p. 47. International shipment rate tables start on p. 114. Next, choose a FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ service. For international shipments, determine your service option (door-to-door, dropoff, hold-at-location, or dropoff and hold-at-location). Then find your chargeable weight from step 2 above and multiply it by the per-pound rate.
3. Determine fees. See fees and other non-transportation charges that may apply starting on p. 124. For FedEx Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Freight U.S. import shipments, call 1.800.332.0807 for service fees applicable from your origin country or territory.

    ${ }^{\text {Â® }}$ If a federal value-added, consumption or similar tax is applicable to your shipment, we reserve the right to add that amount to your shipping charges without notice. We pay any applicable federal excise tax on the air transportation portion of our service.

## Definition

## Additional Handling Surcharge ${ }^{3}$

For U.S. Package Services, the Additional Handling Surcharge rates are determined based on the shipment's zone.
A surcharge applies to any package that:

## (Dimension)*

1) measures greater than 48 inches along its longest side;
2) measures greater than 30 inches along its second-longest side;
3) measures greater than 105 inches in length and girth - the length and girth is length plus (two times the height) plus (two times the width);
*Rating will be based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 40-lb. minimum billable weight. ${ }^{\text {Â® }}$
(Weight)
4) - has an actual weight greater than 50 lbs. (U.S. Package Services);
- has an actual weight greater than $55^{\circledR}$ lbs. (International Package Services);
(Packaging)
Is in non-standard packaging, including any package that:
5) is not fully encased in an outer shipping container;
6) is encased in an outer shipping container not made of corrugated fiberboard (cardboard) materials, including but not limited to metal, wood, canvas, leather, hard plastic, soft plastic (e.g., plastic bags), or expanded polystyrene foam (e.g., Styrofoam);
7) is encased in an outer shipping container covered in shrink wrap or stretch wrap;
8) is encased in a soft-sided pack (e.g., courier packs, poly bags, and bubble mailers) that exceeds 18 inches along its longest side or 13 inches along its second-longest side or 5 inches in height; ${ }^{\text {Â® }}$
9) is round or cylindrical, including (without limitation) mailing tubes, cans, buckets, barrels, tires, drums, or pails;
10) is bound with metal, plastic, or cloth banding, or has wheels, casters, handles, or straps (e.g., a bicycle) (including packages where the outer surface area is loosely wrapped, or where the contents protrude outside the surface area); or
11) could become entangled in or cause damage to other packages or the FedEx sortation system.
Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package's dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the dimensions change during transit, FedEx may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time. This surcharge applies per piece even if multiple pieces are bundled in a shipment. We reserve the right to assess additional handling charges for packages that require special handling or that require FedEx to apply additional packaging during transit.

## Definition

## Additional Handling Surcharge ${ }^{3}$ (cont.)

## Express Freight Services

A surcharge applies to any freight handling unit that measures greater than 62 inches along its longest side. This surcharge applies on a per-freight-handling-unit basis even if multiple pieces of freight are bundled in a shipment. We reserve the right to assess additional handling charges for freight and any freight handling unit that require special handling during transit.

## Demand - Additional Handling Surcharge

During specified times of the year, the Demand - Additional Handling Surcharge will apply to packages meeting the criteria and characteristics of the Additional Handling Surcharge (see above).

## Additional Handling Surcharge - Non-stackable

A surcharge applies to any freight handling unit of a freight shipment that is nonstackable. Non-stackable means the freight handling unit cannot be stacked vertically in a safe and secure manner. Examples include, but are not limited to, non-stackable freight handling units that: 1) do not have a flat and stable top or base; 2) may be damaged if another piece is loaded on them; or 3) have flat and stable loading surfaces but are too narrow to safely and securely support other freight handling units (e.g., 1-2 barrels or drums). A surcharge also applies to any freight handling unit identified by the shipper as non-stackable. This surcharge applies on a per-freight-handling-unit basis even if multiple pieces of freight are bundled in a shipment.

Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package's dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the dimensions change during transit, FedEx may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time.

## Transportation fees and related surcharges

## Definition

## Address Correction

If the shipper provides an incomplete or incorrect recipient address, we may attempt to find the correct address and complete delivery. We may use the address included in the shipper's electronic shipment information to determine whether an address correction is necessary. We will assess a shipping fee. For shipments receiving FedEx Express Multiweight ${ }^{\circledR}$ pricing, the fee is $\$ 24$ per package up to a maximum of $\$ 168$ per shipment. Address correction is also required if the recipient phone number is omitted for a Rural Delivery (RD) address or a Star Route Assignment (SRA) address in Alaska. If we are unable to complete delivery, we are not liable for failing to meet our delivery commitment.
Within the U.S., we also will assess this fee if the address is a P.O. box number or P.O. box ZIP code. For international shipments destined to a P.O. box address, we may assess the fee if a valid telephone, fax, or telex number is not provided for the recipient.
For FedEx International Broker Select, ${ }^{\circledR}$ the address correction fee will apply if the broker's address is incomplete or incorrect on the air waybill or other shipping documentation. If we cannot determine the correct address or cannot reach the broker, we may attempt to contact the sender for address clarification or instructions to return the shipment. If we are unable to complete delivery under these circumstances, we will not be liable for failing to meet our delivery commitment.
For FedEx Ground ${ }^{\circledR}$ and FedEx Home Delivery ${ }^{\circledR}$ shipments, if the shipper provides an incomplete, incorrect, or P.O. box recipient address, we may attempt to determine the correct address, complete delivery, and notify the shipper of the address correction. We may use the address included in the shipper's electronic shipment information to determine whether an address correction is necessary. We assess an additional charge for delivery or attempted delivery to the corrected address. For shipments with contract-only FedEx Ground Multiweight ${ }^{\circledR}$ pricing, the fee is $\$ 24$ per package up to a maximum of $\$ 72$ per shipment. The money-back guarantee does not apply to these shipments, and we are not liable for failing to complete delivery or meet our scheduled delivery time.

## Broker Select Option Fee

FedEx International Broker Select shipments may be routed to the FedEx in-bond location that serves your customs broker. When this occurs and you choose to have us deliver the shipment to a recipient who is served by a different FedEx location than your customs broker (such as in a different metropolitan area), a fee may apply.

## Change of Air Waybill Charge

A charge applies to any change on the air waybill due to new sender instructions received after a FedEx International Premium ${ }^{\circledR}$ shipment has left the airport of departure. When the sender changes the destination and additional shipping is required, the sender is liable for the shipping charges as originally routed, plus transportation charges between the original and amended destination airports.

## Clearance Services and Related Fees

FedEx provides import clearance processing for international express package and international express freight shipments, and international ground shipments. FedEx may charge a clearance service fee, where applicable, on international shipments for clearance processing, for services requested by the shipper, recipient, or importer of record; or to recover the costs passed to FedEx by the regulatory agency for regulatory filing. Clearance service fees that are invoiced are described on a separate line item on the duty-and-tax invoice.
We may apply these service fees, which are subject to change, to either a U.S.- or non-U.S.-based shipper, recipient, or designated third party.

or 3) we, at our sole discretion, determine the package may not be released. If delivery of a shipment to a residential address (including a residence used as an office) cannot be completed on the initial attempt, we may, at our sole discretion, either reattempt delivery, hold the shipment until we contact the recipient for further delivery instructions, or both. After three attempts to deliver and/or three attempts to notify the recipient, or five business days from the date of shipment, whichever occurs first, the shipment may be considered undeliverable.
FedEx First Overnight and FedEx International First (U.S. Inbound). We may provide three delivery attempts.

Express Freight. For more information, see Delivery Reattempt Charge on previous page.

## Demand Surcharge

During specified times of the year, the Demand Surcharge will apply to packages meeting the criteria and characteristics as determined by FedEx.

## Dimensional Weight

Dimensional weight is calculated by multiplying the length by width by height of each package in inches and dividing the total by $139^{4}$. When dimensional weight applies per shipment, calculate the volume of each piece or freight handling unit in the shipment (multiply the length by width by height), then add those volumes together and divide the total by $139^{4}$. If the dimensional weight exceeds the actual weight, charges may be assessed based on the dimensional weight. If the chargeable weight of a FedEx Ground, FedEx Home Delivery, or FedEx International Ground shipment exceeds 150 lbs., a prorated per-pound rate will be used. Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package's dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the dimensions change during transit, FedEx may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time.
Dimensions of one-half inch or greater are rounded up to the next whole number; dimensions less than one-half inch are rounded down.
FedEx applies dimensional weight to all shipments in customer packaging and may apply it to shipments in FedEx packaging. Dimensional weight applies on a per-package or per-shipment basis for U.S. shipments, international shipments, and U.S.-to-Puerto Rico shipments. Dimensional weight is applicable on a per-freight-handling-unit basis for U.S. express freight shipments and on a per-freight-handling-unit or per-shipment basis for FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy Freight, and FedEx International Deferred Freight shipments. See fedex.com/content/dam/fedex/us-united-states/services/IPOIF_ TermsCond.pdf for FedEx International Premium dimensional weight information.
FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments apply dimensional weight on a perpackage basis.

## Duties and Taxes

Duties and taxes, including goods and services tax (GST) and value-added tax (VAT), may be assessed on the contents of the shipment. Any such charges will be billed to the recipient, unless you instruct us otherwise. In the event we disburse duties and taxes on any given shipment to a customs agency, the payer will be assessed a clearance service fee based on a flat rate or on a percentage of the total amount disbursed (see the Disbursement Fee [may be identified as Advancement Fee or Duty Handling Fee in certain countries] listed under Clearance Services and Related Fees.

## Multiple-Piece Shipments

For FedEx package services, you can ship multiple pieces as a multiple-piece shipment if the pieces: 1) use the same service, bill-to instructions, packaging type, and delivery instructions (including FedEx Delivery Signature Options, FedEx Express Saturday pickup or delivery, Hold at Location, or FedEx Home Delivery convenient delivery options); 2) move together on the same day from one sender to one recipient; and 3) meet all size, weight, and acceptance guidelines for the selected service. Individual packages in a multiple-piece shipment may have different weights, dimensions, and declared value. Within the U.S. only, individual packages in a multiple-piece shipment processed using FedEx electronic shipping solutions may contain different designations of dangerous goods or hazardous materials. All labeling requirements, guidelines, and restrictions apply. Each individual piece or single handling unit must have an address label showing complete sender and recipient addresses.
Multiple-piece shipments tendered as express freight must be palletized, stackable, forkliftable, banded, and shrinkwrapped to form single freight handling units.
Once a multiple-piece shipment tendered via a U.S. package service reaches a total shipment weight of 100 lbs . ( 200 lbs . for FedEx Express Saver or with contract-only FedEx Ground Multiweight rates). It is rated based on price per package and price per total shipment weight. You are billed the lower of the two rates. A 15-lb. average minimum package weight for the shipment applies. For contract-only FedEx Ground Multiweight rates, an average minimum package weight for the shipment applies and varies by contract. FedEx One Rate multiple-piece shipments are not eligible for FedEx Multiweight pricing.
FedEx international multiple-piece shipments are billed based on total shipment weight. Package weights are summed to get the total shipment weight. Package rated weights can be based on weights or dimensional weights that were FedEx-captured or customerprovided on individual packages. Packages can also be rated based on weights or dimensional weights that were calculated based on total shipment weight and distributed across individual packages, or a combination thereof. Invoices include associated messages describing which of the package weights or dimensions was used if package detailed billing is enabled.
All FedEx electronic shipping solutions can create shipping labels for FedEx multiple piece shipments within the U.S., and will place a master tracking number and package count sequence and total on each label. A FedEx Package US Airbill or FedEx Freight US Airbill can accept up to 999 pieces as a multiple-piece shipment (except for shipments in FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelope or FedEx 10kg Box and FedEx 25kg Box packaging).

## Northern Canada Surcharge

An additional charge applies for packages destined to the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Labrador. This surcharge applies to postal codes A0K, A0P-A0R, A2V, and X0A-Y9Z. Packages weighing more than 70 lbs . may be refused or returned to the shipper. However, at our sole discretion, they may be accepted and delivered.

## Payer Rebilling

For every request to change the billing instructions for a shipment, we will assess a rebill fee to the shipper in addition to shipping charges. If a recipient or third party refuses to pay or claims no knowledge of shipment, we will assess a rebill fee to the shipper in addition to the shipping charges. If a bill-to third party or recipient requests a rebill to a third party or recipient, we will not assess a rebill fee to any party.

## Pickup Charge (FedEx International Premium)

FedEx International Premium is an airport-to-airport service. Pickup at the shipper's location is available for an additional fee. The fees are: minimum charge $\$ 20, \$ 0.16$ per pound for shipments that weigh 100-220 lbs., $\$ 0.14$ per pound for shipments that weigh 221-660 lbs., and $\$ 0.12$ per pound for shipments that weigh 661 lbs . or more.

## Reroute of Shipment

A shipping fee is billed to the account number specified on the FedEx airbill or shipping label for each rerouted package; it appears as an address correction on the invoice. Reroutes can include delivering to a different address in the same city or changing a hold-at-location instruction to courier delivery. Only one reroute is allowed per package. Any requested change to an address that is not a reroute or an address correction is a new shipment, and new shipping charges will apply. For shipments receiving FedEx Multiweight pricing, the fee is $\$ 24$ per package up to a maximum of $\$ 168$ per shipment.

These FedEx Terms and Conditions, contained in the FedEx Service Guide, supersede all previous terms and conditions, tariffs, amendments, supplements, and other prior statements concerning the rates and conditions of services to which these terms and conditions apply. The contract of carriage as expressed in these terms and conditions constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties or any agents, affiliates, or subcontractors thereof (including FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. and its agents, affiliates, and employees ["FedEx Office"]) with respect to the subject matter hereof, and each party warrants that it has not relied and will not be relying upon any evaluation, representation, or advice from the other party, its agents, affiliates, or subcontractors (including any agents, affiliates, or employees of FedEx Office) except representations expressly made in writing in these terms and conditions. The downloadable version (PDF) of the FedEx Terms and Conditions at fedex.com on the date of shipment is controlling.

FedEx reserves the right to unilaterally modify, amend, change, or supplement the FedEx Service Guide, including, but not limited to, the rates, services, features of service, and these terms and conditions, without notice. Only an officer in the Legal Department of Federal Express Corporation or successor positions may authorize a supplement to, or modification, change, or amendment of, the FedEx Service Guide. No other agent or employee of FedEx, its affiliates, or subsidiaries, nor any other person or party, is authorized to do so. This restriction in modification does not apply to a modification applicable to a single customer and included in a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement.

The FedEx Service Guide consists of the service information at fedex.com/serviceguide and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide (U.S. and U.S. export), U.S., U.S. export, U.S. import, and U.S. retail rates; and these FedEx Terms and Conditions. The FedEx Terms and Conditions and rates in this book and at fedex. com/serviceguide make up the contract of carriage under which your shipments are transported, unless modified under a separate agreement.

To the extent a conflict exists between a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement and these FedEx Terms and Conditions, the FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement controls.

## Non-waiver

Any failure by us to enforce or apply a term, condition, or provision of the FedEx Service Guide does not constitute a waiver of that term, condition, or provision and does not otherwise impair our right to enforce such term, condition, or provision.

## Account numbers

All shipments originating in the U.S. and paid for with cash, check, or debit or credit card must be tendered at a staffed shipping location, and will be charged FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ Retail Rates.

For transactions other than "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient" or "Bill Third Party," you must pay by cash (not accepted at all FedEx locations), check, money order, or credit card. Payment is required when you give us your package. For "Bill Sender" and "Bill Third Party" transactions, packages will not be accepted unless you provide a valid FedEx account number. For "Bill Recipient" transactions, packages can be tendered without payment, but in order for the package to be delivered, the recipient must provide a valid FedEx account number or pay with cash, check, or money order at time of delivery. If the recipient refuses to pay, the package will be treated as undeliverable and the sender will be responsible for all transportation charges and other fees, including all special handling fees.

For customers utilizing our electronic systems, a valid FedEx account number is required for "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party" transactions.

Account numbers are issued by FedEx according to shipping location and are nontransferable. Account numbers are issued and used solely at the discretion of FedEx. FedEx may discontinue the use of accounts, in whole or in part, and terminate all or particular accounts and account numbers at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Improper, illegal, or any other misuse of your FedEx account may also, at the sole discretion of FedEx, result in loss of discounts or termination of the account. Improper, illegal, or other misuse includes, but is not limited to, ordering supplies for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, unauthorized consolidation of shipments owned by different parties, or violations of the terms and conditions in this FedEx Service Guide. If your account has been compromised or stolen, the account may be closed and you may be issued a new account. However, you will be responsible for all valid charges on the closed account. Any supplies, materials, rights, or privileges that you acquire by holding a FedEx account number may not be used for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, and FedEx may seek damages against you for any improper, illegal, or other misuse of your account. If your account is terminated, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny your application for new or additional FedEx account numbers at any time in the future. Except for Canada- and Puerto Rico-based accounts, international account numbers may not be used for shipments between two points within the U.S. All charges will be billed and must be remitted in U.S. funds.

Any individual or entity that uses the FedEx account or shipping discounts of another FedEx account holder without authorization will be charged Standard List Rates for all such shipments without prior notice. This includes all shipments, whether they are classified as "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party," or any other method of billing. Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, using the shipping discount of another FedEx account holder without the knowledge and permission of both FedEx and the account holder.

All requests for account numbers are subject to credit investigation and verification by our Credit Department and Customer Account Confirmation Department. FedEx utilizes business credit reporting agencies, audited financial statements, Standard \& Poor's and Moody's bond ratings, and other sources as necessary, to determine eligibility for open credit terms. FedEx does not offer consumer credit privileges. Any individual shipping for personal use must prepay the shipment charges or establish a FedEx account for billing directly to a major credit card. Stored-value cards or gift cards cannot be used to open an account; however, such cards may be used for payment when tendering a package at staffed FedEx shipping locations, and in conjunction with our credit card acceptance policy. If your FedEx account is billed directly to a credit card, you agree to the following terms: (1) you authorize FedEx to initiate variable charges to the credit card to settle charges payable to FedEx; (2) you authorize FedEx to charge your card for any unpaid amounts on your account; (3) you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts associated with your account without requiring a signed receipt; (4) you agree to keep your card information current (FedEx may receive updates on your card information from participating issuing banks and may update your account profile to avoid service disruptions); (5) you agree that FedEx shall have no liability for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred from attempts to charge and/or place holds on your card; and (6) your agreement to these terms and conditions is to be accepted as authorization to the card issuer to pay all amounts associated with your account.

The party to whom a FedEx account number is issued is liable for all charges to the account, including those resulting from unauthorized use. The account holder is responsible for the safekeeping of the account number. The account number should be released only to those authorized to ship on the account.

Failure to keep your FedEx account current may result in "termination" of FedEx services and your account being placed on a cash-only status. Use of an account on
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

U.S. shipments

## (Account numbers, cont.)

cash-only status may result in your package being delayed, rejected, or returned until arrangements for payment are completed. If the account number to be billed is not valid, the shipment may be delayed until an alternative form of payment is secured. If a package is held, returned, or delivery is otherwise delayed because the account is not in good credit standing, you will not be entitled to a refund or credit of your transportation charges under the Service Failure Money-Back Guarantee Policy.

You must use your FedEx account number to obtain any discount applicable to your account. Use of your account number constitutes your agreement that all packages shipped by us shall be subject to these terms and conditions, as modified, amended, or supplemented.

For FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments, you may only request FedEx to bill accounts with a U.S. or Canadian billing address. Any request for FedEx to bill otherwise is null and void, and FedEx, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to bill the sender for those charges and assess an invalid account surcharge.

FedEx may provide trade credit information on its account holders to credit bureaus.

## Alcoholic beverages

Only licensed entities holding a state and federal license or retailers holding a state license may ship alcohol with FedEx. Shipments containing alcoholic beverages are prohibited to locations where FedEx service uses a postal service, an interline cartage agent, or a freight forwarder for final delivery. Shippers must enter into an approved FedEx Alcohol Shipping Agreement before shipping any alcohol with FedEx.

The recipient's FedEx account number must be provided on the airbill at the time of shipment, or by the recipient at the time of delivery, and must be in good credit standing.

"Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT" should not be confused with C.O.D. service.

When shipping packages using the FedEx Ground COLLECT service option, the sender agrees to pay all additional charges and surcharges related to the shipment other than those billed to the recipient, as described above. The sender agrees to ship packages collect only to recipients authorized by FedEx to receive collect shipments.

A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request.
4. Requests for invoice adjustment due to an overcharge must be received within 180 days after the original invoice date (or ship date if prepaid by cash, check, money order, or credit card). For adjustments due to a service failure, see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section.
5. FedEx account holders are responsible for timely monitoring charges to their accounts and are deemed on notice of charges once they have been invoiced. A FedEx account holder requesting invoice adjustment due to unauthorized account use or fraud (or "Fraud Dispute") must immediately notify FedEx of the activity on the affected account(s) upon discovery of unauthorized activity. FedEx, in its sole discretion, will determine if the proof submitted by the party requesting an invoice adjustment is sufficient to establish that the disputed charges were not authorized. Any FedEx account holder making a Fraud Dispute must submit that Fraud Dispute to FedEx within 30 days of receiving the contested invoice (or within 30 days of the ship date if prepaid by cash, check, money order, or credit card). All suspected fraudulent activity related to a FedEx account must be submitted to the Fraud and Security Controls team at 1.800.584.2681.

0. Additional Taxes. If a federal value-added, consumption or similar tax is applicable to your shipment, we reserve the right to add that amount to your shipping charges without notice. We pay any applicable federal excise tax on the air transportation portion of our service.

We reserve the right to audit shipments to verify service selection, shipment weight, and dimensions. Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package's dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the service selected, weight entered, or dimensions entered are incorrect or change during transit, we may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time.
P. The sender is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in attempting to obtain payment on any transaction. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, and interest and court costs.
Q. The shipper and any other party who is liable for payment are responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest, and court costs.
R. At our sole discretion, FedEx may transfer and assign ownership of, and any rights to collect, any and all charges due and payable to us.
S. Missing or Invalid Account Number. An account number is invalid if it is not the correct account number for the bill-to party, or it is the account number for a recipient or third party who fails to pay the shipping charges. An additional charge will be assessed for each missing or invalid account number.

# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

U.S. shipments

## (Cartage agents, cont.)

A. Our delivery commitment time and money-back guarantee policy apply only to the portion of the transportation handled directly by us (see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section). The delivery commitment time begins when the cartage agent tenders the shipment to us and ends when a shipment is available for pickup by you or a cartage agent. Our tender of a shipment to a cartage agent constitutes delivery of the shipment by us for all purposes. Except as stated below for FedEx Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Freight shipments, we are not responsible for service failures as a result of cartage agent pickups or deliveries.
B. For FedEx Express Freight shipments destined to extended service areas (H4, H5, H6) and when FedEx arranges delivery by a cartage agent, our delivery commitment time and money-back guarantee policy apply to both the portion of the transportation handled directly by us and to the portion of the transportation handled by the cartage agent. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section.) For FedEx Express Freight shipments originating in extended service areas (H4, H5, H6, H7) the delivery commitment time begins when the cartage agent tenders the shipment to FedEx.
C. For FedEx Express Freight shipments destined to H7 extended service areas, our delivery commitment time, and money-back guarantee policy apply only to the portion of the transportation handled directly by us. The delivery commitment time ends when a shipment is available at the FedEx location for pickup by you or a cartage agent. We are not responsible for service failures as a result of cartage agent pickups from, or deliveries to, H7 extended service areas.
D. If you elect to make arrangements for pickup or delivery directly with a cartage agent, you are responsible for all charges and fees assessed by the cartage agent. The invoice you receive from us will reflect only our charges and fees.
E. A special handling fee applies; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide.
F. Cartage agents are independent contractors. They are neither employees nor agents of FedEx, and we are not responsible for any of their acts or omissions.

## Claims

A. Filing of Claims:

1. All claims for loss of or damage to property tendered to FedEx for transportation in interstate or intrastate commerce (U.S.) must be filed in writing; must include or refer to the Customer Shipping Record, if applicable, tracking number, and date or other facts sufficient to identify the package involved; and must be accompanied by documents that prove the value of the property and/or extent of the loss or damage.
Documentation Requirements. Such documents may include original purchase invoices, estimates, or invoices for repair (repairs are not authorized under this provision and should not be made until FedEx has inspected the damaged package or expressly waived its right to inspect the damaged package), expense statements, appraisal, final confirmation screen if online order with proof of purchase, or other certified documents; must assert our liability for the alleged loss or damage; and must make claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money. A request for proof of delivery does not constitute the filing of a claim.
i. Notification. In the case of a claim for concealed loss or damage that is not discovered at the time of delivery, the sender or recipient must notify FedEx as promptly as possible after the discovery of the damage, and in any event no later than 60 days after the date of delivery. Notification does not constitute filing of a claim as required in section C below.
Except as provided in the paragraph above, receipt of the shipment by the recipient without written notice of damage on the delivery record is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. As a condition to FedEx considering a claim, all the original shipping cartons, packing (inner and outer), and contents must be made available for FedEx inspections. See the Damaged Property section below for additional details. Package and contents must be retained by the claimant until the claim is resolved.
2. You can provide notification for concealed loss or damage and file a claim in the following ways:
a. Submit claims online at fedex.com/en-us/customer-support/claims.html for U.S. shipments, U.S. export shipments to Canada and U.S.-inbound shipments from Canada.
i. Call customer service at 1.800.463.3339 (say "Claims") to obtain a case number for your claim. All supporting documents, including the additional claim form sent via email, must be submitted via the online portal at fedex. com/claimdocuments.
3. FedEx will not voluntarily pay a claim for an uncertain amount, such as * $\$ 100$ more or less." FedEx is not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges
are paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or any outstanding balance.
4. Bad order reports, appraisal reports of damage, notations of exceptions on delivery records or other documents, inspection reports issued by FedEx inspectors or inspection agencies, requests for proof of delivery, and tracer or inspection requests standing alone are not sufficient to comply with these claim filing requirements. 5. FedEx shipment-status information is not intended or permitted to be used by the shipper to file claims. (See Shipment-Status Information in the Proof of Delivery section.)
5. In the event that a sender requests FedEx to bill the recipient or a third party for a shipment, and the payer agreed to waive or otherwise limit its right to submit claims, the payer's waiver or other limitation will be imputed to the sender.
6. If the party filing the claim is not the shipper or the payor of transportation charges to FedEx, customers must obtain and provide a claim filing waiver from the shipper (on company letterhead if the shipper is a company).
7. We do not accept claims from customers whose packages were sent through a package consolidator. (See the Package Consolidators section.)
8. Only one claim can be filed in connection with a shipment. Acceptance of payment of a claim shall extinguish any right to recover in connection with that shipment.
9. When we resolve a claim by paying full value for a shipment, we reserve the right to pick up the package for salvage, and all rights, title to, and interest in the package shall vest with us.
10. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN THE DENIAL OF A CLAIM.
11. FedEx reserves the option to pick up salvage on damaged claims when the claim is paid in full.
B. Time Limit for Filing Claims. Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be filed in writing with FedEx within nine months from the date of delivery, or, in the event that FedEx failed to make delivery, within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx for shipment. Suits against FedEx must be instituted within two years and one day from the date FedEx gives written notice that FedEx has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. If claims are not filed or suits are not instituted in accordance with the foregoing provisions, FedEx will not be liable and such claims will not be paid. A Claim Reporting Form can be requested from a FedEx account representative or by calling 1.800.463.3339 (say "claims").
C. Investigation of Claims:
12. Each claim must be supported by the original Customer Shipping Record (if applicable), evidence that applicable transportation charges have been paid, and documents that prove the value of the property, and/or extent of the loss or damage. Such documents may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair, expense statements, appraisals, or other certified documents. The documents must be verifiable to our satisfaction. Where the property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the recipient, or where an invoice does not show price or value, or where the property involved has not been sold, or where the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, FedEx will, before voluntarily paying a claim thereon, require the claimant to establish the destination value of the quantity shipped, transported or involved, and to certify the correctness of the valuations in writing.
13. When a claim for loss of an entire package or an entire shipment cannot otherwise be authenticated upon investigation, FedEx may request from the recipient of the shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.
14. In the event that the shipper and the recipient have refused a package, the property shall thereupon pass to FedEx. FedEx will not honor a claim for an abandoned package.
D. Damaged Property:
15. FedEx Discovered Damage. Whenever property is damaged by FedEx in the course of transportation and discovered by FedEx prior to delivery, FedEx will either (1) return the damaged property to the shipper or (2) remove any damaged property and ship the balance of undamaged merchandise. If determined to be liable and if damaged property is returned to the shipper, FedEx may, at the shipper's request, pay the full actual or declared value of the property, whichever is lower, and title of the property shall thereupon pass to FedEx. If the shipper makes such a request, the shipper must hold the damaged property until FedEx has completed the processing of the shipper's claim. FedEx shall not be liable for any special, incidental, or consequential damages.
16. Concealed Loss or Damage. Whenever property is delivered by FedEx and damage or loss is subsequently discovered by the recipient, inspection may be made by FedEx
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

U.S. shipments

## (Claims, cont.)

as promptly as practicable after receipt of request from the recipient or shipper. The shipper or recipient must notify FedEx as promptly as possible after discovery of the damage, and in any event no later than 60 days after the date of delivery. FedEx reserves the right to inspect a damaged shipment on customer premises as well as the right to retrieve the damaged shipment for inspection at a local FedEx facility. All of the original shipping cartons, packing, and contents must be available for our inspection and retained until the claim is concluded. Inspection will include examination of the damaged property, the shipping container and its packing, and any other action necessary to establish all the facts. If a shortage is involved, the inspector will compare the contents of package with the invoice, weigh the shipping container and contents, or conduct any other type of investigation necessary to establish that a loss has occurred. In either case, the inspection will be limited to a factual report. The shipper and recipient must cooperate with FedEx to assist in the inspection. A written record of our findings will be made and a copy given to the shipper for claim support upon request. Any inspection report issued will be incorporated into the claim file. FedEx reserves the right to request a self-inspection requiring proof of damage in the form of photographs of the carton, inner packaging, and damaged contents. If requested, this documentation must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx for shipment.

The terms and conditions applicable to the original shipment (including, but not limited to, any declared value or limitation of liability) will govern the disposition of all claims in connection with said shipment, including any claim relative to the retrieval, inspection, or return of said shipment.
3. In the event FedEx does not make an inspection, the recipient must make the inspection and record all information pertinent to the cause. The recipient's inspection, in such case, may be considered as the FedEx inspection and will not jeopardize any recovery due the shipper based on the facts contained in the report.
E. Spotted Trailers. The shipper agrees to load any trailers spotted at its facilities within 48 hours after being spotted with 225 or more packages per trailer. The shipper agrees not to file claims on any package shortages for spotted trailers. Upon written request from the shipper, FedEx agrees to notify the shipper of any package shortages within 120 hours after the shipper's packages are transmitted to FedEx. Notification to the shipper shall include date of pickup and the number of packages short of the total provided by the shipper on a computer-generated manifest. The shipper agrees not to file claims in connection with any package shortages reported by FedEx to the shipper.

## Collect on delivery (COD.) service: not offered

We do not offer COD. service for FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2Day A.M., FedEx 2Day, FedEx Express Saver, FedEx 1Day Freight, FedEx 2Day Freight, FedEx 3Day Freight, FedEx Ground, or FedEx Home Delivery shipments.

B. FedEx will extend credit to shippers who, in the sole judgment of FedEx, are creditworthy.
C. As a condition of extending credit privileges, FedEx reserves the right to require business customers to provide current financial information, agree to bank draft arrangements for payment on account, provide a security deposit, or provide a bank letter of credit.

1. Deposit Plan. After depositing an amount equivalent to four weeks' transportation charges as estimated by FedEx, payments are required within 15 days of invoice date. The deposit amount is subject to change to reflect revised estimates of the shipper's charges.
2. Under the deposit plan, no interest will be paid by FedEx, nor will additional charges be rendered for their services. Net balances will be refunded at the request of the shipper.
D. When credit privileges are extended, FedEx reserves the right to establish and enforce a credit limit on your account. At our sole discretion, we may review and amend a credit limit on your account.
E. The invoice date begins the credit term cycle, and payment is due within 15 days from the invoice date. A late payment fee will be assessed if your payment and required remittance data that supports the payment is not received by FedEx by the invoice due date. The late payment fee will equal 8\% of the total past-due balance of any invoice that is past due. Failure to keep your FedEx account current will result in your account being placed on cash-only status. This status may impair your ability to use our services, delay your shipments, and may result in the loss of any applicable discounts. Refer to the Billing Section
of the Service Guide Terms \& Conditions and the Billing and Invoicing section under Support on fedex.com for required remittance data guidelines.
F. IF THE ACCOUNT NUMBER TO BE BILLED IS NOT IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING, THE PACKAGE MAY BE HELD OR STOPPED IN TRANSIT UNTIL YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. THE MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE POLICY WILL NOT APPLY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.
G. The shipper, and any other party who is liable for payment, is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest, and court costs.
H. Credit privileges will not be restored until you have paid all past-due balances in full and all costs, including but not limited to late fees and expenses incurred by FedEx in collecting or attempting to collect such balances. FedEx may require you to secure the account with a form of payment as a prerequisite to credit restoration. FedEx may decline to restore credit privileges even if all costs, all fees, and expenses are paid.
I. Customers requesting the reinstatement of their FedEx service or removal from cashonly status must contact the Recovery Collections department at 1.800.506.7580.
J. At our sole discretion, we may apply payments made on your account to any unpaid invoice issued on your account.
K. Requests for research or refunds of payment must be received within 60 days from the date of payment.
L. When payment and required remittance data that supports the payment is not received by the invoice due date for FedEx accounts that are established outside of the U.S., but that are billed to a U.S.-based address, the late payment fee will be assessed regardless of the origin of the FedEx account and governing contract of carriage terms. Refer to the Billing Section of the Service Guide Terms \& Conditions and the Billing and Invoicing section under Support on fedex.com for required remittance data guidelines.

I. When the shipper sends more than one package on an airbill, the total declared value for all the packages moving on the airbill must be written in the appropriate section of the airbill. Our liability will be limited to the total declared value (not to exceed the per-package limit of US $\$ 500$ or US $\$ 50,000$ or the per-shipment limit of US $\$ 2,000$, as described in this section).

We are not liable for any concealed damage to items returned using FedEx Print Return Label, FedEx Email Return Label, FedEx ExpressTag, or FedEx Stamps. Receipt of the shipment by the recipient without notice of damage on delivery is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. Our liability for any loss or damage will not exceed the actual amount of the damage or the declared-value amount, whichever is lower. All other terms and conditions related to FedEx claims regulations apply for shipments sent via a FedEx return option.
M. ANY EFFORT TO DECLARE A VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUMS ALLOWED IN THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE IS NULL AND VOID. OUR ACCEPTANCE FOR CARRIAGE OF ANY SHIPMENT BEARING A DECLARED VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWED MAXIMUMS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY PROVISION OF THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE AS TO SUCH SHIPMENT.
N. REGARDLESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE OF A PACKAGE, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION, ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, OR MISDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, WILL NOT EXCEED A SHIPMENT'S REPAIR COST, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE, OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.

## Delivery Signature Options

FedEx offers Delivery Signature Options for shippers. Not available for all shipments or to all destinations.
A. Indirect Signature Required. FedEx will obtain a signature in one of three ways:

1. From someone at the delivery address; or
2. From a neighbor, building manager, or other person at a neighboring address; or
3. The recipient can sign a FedEx door tag or utilize FedEx Delivery Manager to authorize release of the package without anyone present.
If delivery cannot be completed in these ways, FedEx may reattempt delivery.
B. Direct Signature Required. FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address. If no one is at the address, FedEx will reattempt delivery.
C. Adult Signature Required. FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at least 21 years old at the delivery address (government- issued photo identification required). If no eligible recipient is at the address, FedEx will reattempt delivery.
D. Shipments to residential addresses may be released without obtaining a signature. If you require a signature for a residential shipment, select one of the Delivery Signature Options. E. Indirect Signature Required is not available for shipments to nonresidential addresses. F. FedEx may accept requests for address corrections from a shipper or a recipient for shipments involving the Direct Signature Required or Indirect Signature Required Options, alcohol shipments, and shipments where no signature is required.
G. FedEx will assess the delivery signature charge if the shipper requests the Delivery Signature Option, even if a signature is not obtained, the option requested is not available, or FedEx is unable to provide a copy of the signature obtained at delivery.
H. Also see the Billing, Money-Back Guarantee, Liabilities Not Assumed, Pickup and Delivery, and Proof of Delivery sections.

## Dimensional weight (volumetric weight)

Transportation charges may be assessed based on dimensional weight, which is a volumetric standard. Dimensional-weight pricing is applicable on a per-package or pershipment basis to all shipments in customer packaging. FedEx packaging may also be subject to dimensional-weight pricing. If the dimensional weight exceeds the actual weight, charges based on the dimensional weight will be assessed. Customers who fail to apply the dimensional-weight calculation to a package may be assessed dimensional-weight charges from FedEx. See the Dimensional Weight description in the Other Transportation-Related Fees and Shipping Information section of the FedEx Service Guide for additional details.

## Extra-large packages

FedEx shipments (except for FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments) weighing less than 151 lbs . that exceed 165 inches in length and girth combined ("extralarge" packages) may be accepted as FedEx Express Freight U.S. shipments. These pieces do not have to be palletized (skidded), stackable, or forkliftable. Dimensional-weight pricing is applicable on a per-freight-handling-unit basis for extra-large packages. The chargeable weight is the greater of the actual weight or dimensional weight for extralarge packages and is applied on a per-freight-handling-unit basis. Each freight handling unit is also subject to a minimum billable weight of 151 lbs . regardless of its actual weight.

FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments weighing more than 150 lbs., measuring more than 108 inches in length, and measuring more than 165 inches in length and girth combined are unauthorized and may be refused, returned to the shipper, or disposed of by FedEx. Refer to the Ground Unauthorized Package Charge for conditions.

The length and girth of a package is length plus ( 2 times the height) plus ( 2 times the width). If the dimension includes a fraction, a fraction of one-half or greater will be rounded up to the next whole number; less than one-half will be rounded down to the next whole number.

## Firearms

Only customers holding a Federal Firearms License (FFL) and federal, state, or local government agencies may ship firearms with FedEx. Customers holding an FFL must enter into an approved FedEx Firearms Shipping Compliance Agreement before shipping any firearms with FedEx. For more information, contact your FedEx account executive.

On behalf of customers holding an FFL who enter into an approved FedEx Firearms Shipping Compliance Agreement and federal, state, or local government agencies, FedEx will transport and deliver firearms, antique firearms, and replica firearms, all as defined by the United States Gun Control Act of 1968, as well as muzzleloaders and black powder firearms (collectively "firearms"). Shipments containing firearms must be sent with the Adult Signature Required or the Direct Signature Required Delivery Signature Option. We will not accept handguns, assembled or disassembled, in FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments.

FedEx will transport ammunition when packed and labeled in compliance with local, state, and federal law, and the Dangerous Goods or Hazardous Materials section of this Service Guide, depending on the FedEx service selected. Ammunition is an explosive and must be shipped separately as dangerous goods or hazardous materials. You agree not to ship loaded firearms or firearms with ammunition in the same package.

## Fuel and other surcharges

We reserve the right to assess fuel and other surcharges on shipments without notice. The duration and amount of any surcharge will be determined at our sole discretion. By tendering your shipment to FedEx, you agree to pay the surcharges, as determined by FedEx. The fuel surcharge rate, if applicable, is available on fedex.com.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

U.S. shipments

## Inspection of shipments and identification requirement

We may, at our sole discretion, open and inspect any shipment without notice. We may, at our sole discretion, require the shipper to provide their government-issued photo identification prior to tendering a package to FedEx.

U.S. shipments

## Limitations on legal actions

Any civil claim for overcharges must be brought within 18 months after the claim accrues. Any civil claim for, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the shipment, must be brought within two years and one day from the date FedEx gives written notice that FedEx has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice.

Any right that you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, the periods and requirements for providing notice under the Billing, Claims, and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections. You and we understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must plead compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against us. You and we agree that FedEx cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until we wrongfully deny a claim submitted to us pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in these terms and conditions. Finally, you and we agree that you will comply with applicable notice periods and requirements even if you believe that such compliance will not result in relief from us or if you lack knowledge regarding whether such compliance will result in relief from us.

You agree that you will not sue us as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against us. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff.

To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to us.

The performance of any services does not make us an agent of the shipper or any third party for any purpose.

## Money-back guarantee policy

We offer a money-back guarantee for our services. This guarantee can be suspended, modified, or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.
A. Money-Back Guarantee. At our option, we will, upon request, either refund or credit your transportation charges in the event of a service failure (which means delivery of your package 60 seconds or more after the published delivery commitment for the selected service and destination, except as otherwise described in these terms and conditions). This money-back guarantee is your exclusive remedy in the event of a service failure for the recovery of all or any portion of the FedEx charges for a shipment. If the money-back guarantee is suspended, there is no remedy or recovery of charges for a service failure. There are no delivery commitments for shipments on which the money-back guarantee is suspended.
B. Limitations. The following limitations apply:

1. Credits for transportation charges will be applied to the payer's account only, and refunds will be made payable to the payer only.
2. At the sole discretion of FedEx, the money-back guarantee may not be honored when the request is made by, or the information utilized to determine the status of the package is determined by, a third party other than the payer of the charges.
3. Only one refund or credit is permitted per package. In the case of multiple-piece shipments, the money-back guarantee applies to each package in the shipment. If a service failure occurs for any package within the shipment, a refund or credit will be given only for the portion of the transportation charges applicable to that package.
4. The money-back guarantee for package services destined for areas outside our primary service areas applies only to the portion of the transportation provided directly by us. The money-back guarantee for FedEx Express Freight services destined for areas outside our primary service areas applies to the portion of the transportation provided directly by us and may also apply to the portion of the transportation provided by the cartage agent (see the Cartage Agent section for details).
5. Shipments scheduled for delivery on a holiday will be delivered the next business day. Observance of local holidays (e.g., Mardi Gras, St. Patrick's Day) may cause delivery delays. In both circumstances, the delivery commitment for application of the moneyback guarantee policy will be extended for a period equal to the length of the holiday.
6. If a delivery later than the original delivery commitment is requested by the shipper or recipient before the first delivery attempt is made, the delivery
commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be adjusted to account for the requested delivery date and/or time.
7. If the shipper or recipient informed FedEx that the recipient location is closed on a certain day or at a certain time, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be the next business day at the delivery commitment for the service originally selected.
C. Exceptions. FedEx will not be obligated to refund or credit your transportation charges if:
8. We provide you with proof of timely delivery, consisting of the date and time of delivery and, if applicable, the name of the person who signed for the shipment, or service-exception information reflecting that the failure to deliver timely resulted from circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.
9. The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.
10. The payer's FedEx account number was not in good credit standing, or payment instructions were invalid, and delivery was delayed until payment arrangements were secured.
11. The shipment was scheduled for delivery on the Wednesday immediately prior to Thanksgiving via any FedEx U.S. or FedEx Express Freight U.S. service, and was delivered within 90 minutes of the published delivery commitment for the selected service and destination.
12. The shipment was scheduled for delivery during the seven calendar days before Christmas Day via any FedEx U.S. or FedEx Express Freight U.S. service, and was delivered by the end of the day on the published delivery commitment date for the selected service and destination.
13. The shipment was rerouted from the delivery address to a Hold at Location address.
14. The shipment was undeliverable or returned.
15. Dangerous goods shipments, except those with dry ice as the only dangerous goods in the shipment.
16. The shipment was delayed due to an incorrect address or ZIP code or the unavailability or refusal of an appropriate or eligible person to accept delivery or sign for the package.
17. The shipment was delayed due to security or other regulatory delays, including permanent, regular, or daily security procedures at the recipient location.
18. The package met the definitions for oversize. See the Other TransportationRelated Fees and Shipping Information section for additional details.
D. Refund or Credit Requests. To qualify for a refund or credit due to a service failure, you must notify us of the service failure and request a refund or credit of your transportation charges in compliance with the conditions listed below. If you do not comply with these conditions, you are not entitled to receive a refund or credit and cannot recover compensation for a service failure in any lawsuit.

## Package Consolidators (including FedEx Authorized ShipCenter ${ }^{\circledR}$ locations, and FedEx ShipSite ${ }^{\circledR}$ locations at Office Depot and OfficeMax)

Package Consolidators are responsible for complying with all applicable requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, customs, and other legal requirements applicable to packages tendered for international transportation.
If you tender packages to a Package Consolidator instead of to us directly, the following limitations apply:
A. Package Consolidators are not agents of FedEx, and we are not responsible for any errors or omissions made by them.
B. Package Consolidators may submit claims for refunds or credits for shipping charges under the money-back guarantee policy. Neither the person or entity tendering the package to the Package Consolidator nor the recipient is eligible for refunds or credits under the money-back guarantee policy.
C. In order for a Package Consolidator to receive packaging supplies from FedEx, the Package Consolidator must first enter into a Packaging and Pricing Agreement or a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter Agreement with FedEx.
D. Package Consolidators may charge FedEx Retail Rates for FedEx shipping services, but they are not required to. Package Consolidators set their own rates for reselling FedEx services.
E. FedEx assumes no liability, other than to the Package Consolidator, for lost, damaged, or delayed shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator, as the Package Consolidator is the shipper of these packages. Package Consolidators are independently owned and operated businesses.
F. See the Package Consolidator representative for information regarding rates and services and the terms and conditions of carriage. Inquiries or claims regarding shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator must also be directed to the Package Consolidator.
G. As directed by FedEx, Package Consolidators must require a government-issued photo ID to validate the identity of their customer and must keep a record of the name and address on the ID of their customer for each package.

## Package restrictions (size and weight)

A. FedEx will accept for transport packages that weigh up to the maximum package weight published in the FedEx Service Guide in effect at the time of shipment and that measure up to 165 inches in combined length and girth. FedEx reserves the right to assess additional handling, oversize package, and unauthorized package surcharges on any package whose dimensions are altered during transit, causing it to meet the parameters for these charges.
B. The maximum limits for FedEx U.S. packages are 150 lbs . and 119 inches in length and 165 inches in length and girth. Packages that weigh 150 lbs . or less and exceed 96 inches in length or 130 inches in length and girth will be considered "oversize" packages. Oversize packages will be rated based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 90-lb. minimum billable weight. In addition, an oversize charge will apply; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide.
C. MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH AND GIRTH:

1. Regular-Shaped Packages: The length and girth of a package is length plus (two times the height) plus (two times the width). If the dimension includes a fraction, a fraction of one-half or greater will be rounded up to the next whole number; less than one-half will be rounded down to the next whole number.
2. Irregular-Shaped Packages and Regular-Shaped Articles With Hollow or Open Spaces: To measure combined length and girth, assume the package or article to be enclosed in a six-sided, rectangular container, and then determine the combined length and girth as for regular-shaped packages.
D. Packages that exceed 119 inches in length and 165 inches in length and girth may be refused or, if found in the FedEx package network, may be considered for transportation at our sole discretion. These packages also will be rated based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 90 -lb. minimum billable weight, and an oversize charge will apply.
E. Charge for Unauthorized Packages. In addition to the other rates and charges named in these terms and conditions, a charge will be assessed for the following conditions:
3. A FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery package measuring more than 108 inches in length. ${ }^{\dagger}$
4. A FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery package measuring more than 165 inches in length and girth combined. ${ }^{\dagger}$
5. A FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery package measuring more than 150 lbs. ${ }^{\dagger}$
F. Unauthorized packages will be rated based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 90 -lb. minimum billable weight.
${ }^{\dagger}$ These packages are unauthorized and may be refused, returned to the shipper, or disposed of by FedEx. However, at our sole discretion, they may be accepted and delivered. In the event of disposal, the shipper, if known, agrees to pay any costs incurred in the disposal.

## Packaging and marking

You must comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws, including those governing packing, marking, and labeling for all shipments.
A. All packages must be prepared and packed by the shipper for safe transportation with ordinary care in handling in an express-transportation environment. Any articles susceptible to damage as a result of conditions that may be encountered in transportation, such as changes in temperature or atmospheric pressure, must be adequately protected by proper packaging. Each shipment must be legibly and durably marked with the name, address, and ZIP code of both the shipper and the recipient. Packages cannot be wrapped in kraft paper.

You must use packaging in new or like-new condition. All packaging must be large enough to allow internal cushioning on top, bottom, and sides of contents. Contents must be properly packaged to eliminate shifting.
To be in like-new condition:

- Packaging must not have any holes, tears, dents, or creases.
- Boxes must have no crushed corners.
- All previous shipping labels and barcodes must be covered or concealed.

All flaps, seams, and edges must be securely sealed with a minimum 2-inch-wide packing tape.

Items that cannot be packed into cartons (such as auto tail pipes, mufflers, tires, and rims) must have all sharp edges and protrusions wrapped, and the address label must be secured using the tie-on tag or the tie/crate label provided by FedEx (or you may secure it by wrapping pressure-sensitive tape completely around the object). Briefcases, luggage, garment bags, aluminum cases, plastic cases, computer cartons, or similar types of items whose outer finish might be damaged by adhesive labels, soiling, marking, or other types of surface damage that is normal with ordinary care in handling should be placed in a protective container for shipment. Casters, wheels, and rollers must be removed or packaged.

FedEx Express Saver shipments cannot use the FedEx Small Box, FedEx Medium Box, FedEx Large Box, FedEx Extra Large Box, or FedEx Tube, unless rated with FedEx One Rate pricing. Complimentary FedEx packaging cannot be used for FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery shipments.

Expanded polystyrene foam coolers must be shipped inside a sturdy outer container unless tested and approved for acceptance by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing is available at fedex.com/packaging. Expanded polystyrene foam coolers containing blood, urine, and other non-infectious liquid clinical specimens must be shipped inside a sturdy outer packaging.
B. If a shipment is refused by the recipient, leaks, or is damaged, the shipment will be returned to the sender if possible. If the sender refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage, or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment, and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage.
C. FedEx does not recommend the use of wet ice (frozen water) as a refrigerant. Packages containing wet ice must be prepared to prevent the leakage of any liquid, regardless of package orientation. For additional wet-ice packaging requirements, refer to the packaging guide Packaging Perishable Shipments at fedex.com/packaging.
D. FedEx reserves the right to request a shipper to submit a representative sampling of the packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

U.S. shipments

## (Packaging and marking, cont.)

inspect and test the packaging, or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damages due to improper packaging.
E. FedEx may issue written notice to you if you repeatedly fail to adhere to FedEx's packaging requirements due to your pattern or practice of insufficient packaging. Claims for damage or loss associated with an identified pattern or practice of insufficient packaging will be denied. Any such claim filed related to your shipments will not be paid, regardless of which party files the claim, unless the claimant can establish that the loss or damage did not result from a failure to use proper packaging. FedEx will continue to deny such claims until we determine that you have ceased the pattern or practice of failing to adhere to the packaging requirements. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit FedEx's right to deny a claim where the shipment in dispute is found to have improper packaging.

For FedEx Express Freight shipments, freight must be on a skid, pallet, or other forkliftable base. Boxes should be stacked squarely on the skid without hanging over the edge, and the weight should be distributed evenly on the skid to avoid excess weight being placed on materials inside the cartons. Use 70-gauge stretch wrap and pass a minimum of two bands (tightly secured) through the skid voids and around all cartons.

Information on how to submit your packaging for testing or evaluation, and tips on packaging specific commodities (including automotive and mechanical parts, computers, and perishables), are available at fedex.com/packaging.
F. Fragile Articles/Orientation. Packaging for all fragile articles (including, but not limited to, electronic and electrical devices, scientific testing equipment, fragile glass, crystal, porcelain, or china) should be preapproved by FedEx Packaging Design and Development prior to shipping.
G. Preshipment Inspection and Testing for Oversize Packages. FedEx may, at our sole discretion, require a shipper of packages classified as Oversize, as defined in the Rates section of the FedEx Service Guide, to submit a representative sampling of the oversize packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test oversize packaging or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damage to shipper's oversize packages.
H. FedEx account holders may order supplies via fedex.com or by calling 1.800.463.3339 (say "order shipping supplies").

## Perishables or temperature-sensitive

Perishable or temperature-sensitive shipments contain contents that can be damaged by heat or cold. Common examples include but are not limited to food, medicines/ supplements, plants, electronics, batteries, cosmetics, candles, and certain liquids. Shipments containing perishable or temperature-sensitive articles must be packaged for a minimum transit time of at least 12 hours greater than our delivery commitment for the shipment. Perishables coming from Hawaii to the continental U.S. must be packaged for additional transit time. Shipping perishable articles over a weekend or holiday is discouraged, and packaging such shipments for longer transit times is required. We recommend that you ship perishable items via FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx First Overnight Freight, or FedEx 1Day Freight; utilize service options such as Hold at Location to ensure packages are not left in outdoor conditions; and have your proposed packaging evaluated by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for evaluation is available at fedex.com/packaging. Your failure to use proper packaging releases us from any liability for spoiled perishables that we would otherwise assume (see the Liabilities Not Assumed section).

FedEx does not provide protective services for transportation of perishable or temperature-sensitive commodities or of commodities requiring protection from heat or cold. Such commodities will be accepted for transportation solely at the shipper's risk for loss of value or damage occasioned by exposure to heat or cold. The shipper agrees not to file damage claims for perishable items in FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery shipments.

## Pharmaceuticals

You are responsible for complying with all applicable local, state, and federal laws, regulations, ordinances, and rules governing the shipment of pharmaceuticals. Packages containing pharmaceuticals must not have labels, markings, or other written notice that a pharmaceutical is contained within. Select the Direct Signature Required Delivery Signature Option if you require FedEx to obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address, or the Adult Signature Required Delivery Signature Option if you require an adult signature for delivery. See the Delivery Signature Options section for details.

## Pickup and delivery

## A. Pickup service:

1. FedEx may provide on-call pickup service for a per-stop pickup fee for customers that do not have a FedEx regular scheduled pickup. This fee may be higher if the pickup is made the same day it is requested or if the request is made through FedEx Customer Service.
2. FedEx may provide pickup service for a weekly pickup fee to regular scheduled pickup customers.
3. Charges for pickup service shall apply in addition to the rates set forth in the FedEx Service Guide in effect at the time of shipment. Upon payment of the applicable pickup service charge, FedEx will stop at the shipper's premises once each business day, if required, to pick up packages.
4. The shipper agrees to declare all applicable additional charges on the Customer Shipping Record or Declared Value Shipment Form, if applicable. FedEx reserves the right to assess additional charges on those packages that the shipper does not properly rate and to re-rate packages the shipper fails to rate properly.
5. At the sole discretion of FedEx, some or all of the transportation, handling, and/or service of FedEx shipments may be performed by FedEx, or other carriers as may be selected by FedEx. FedEx will charge the rate applicable to the FedEx service selected by the shipper at the time of tender. The features and services provided by such alternative carriers may differ from those provided by FedEx. In the event FedEx selects another carrier to perform any portion or all of the service selected by the shipper, the remaining terms (or features and services) of FedEx service will continue to be governed by the FedEx terms and conditions contained herein.
B. Delivery service: FedEx does not offer a restricted-delivery service and may deliver to someone other than the person or entity named as the recipient. We also may make an indirect delivery. Indirect delivery is a completed delivery to an address or location other than the address on the label and includes shipments delivered via Indirect Signature Required service.
6. FedEx may release the package with no signature at a residential address if a FedEx Delivery Signature Option is not selected by the Shipper. FedEx will attempt to obtain a signature for shipments to nonresidential addresses, except that when FedEx uses a postal service, an interline cartage agent, or a freight forwarder for final delivery, we may release such shipments with no signature if a FedEx Delivery Signature Option is not selected by the Shipper. If a Delivery Signature Option is selected and FedEx uses a postal service, an interline cartage agent, or a freight forwarder for final delivery, one of the following may occur at our discretion:
7. If available, a cartage agent that can return a signature may be selected; or
8. If a signature cannot be returned, FedEx may call the shipper and request to eliminate the signature requirement; or
9. The package may be returned to the shipper.

Where a signature is required, FedEx may make up to three attempts at delivery. A notice that delivery has been attempted will be left at the recipient's address after the first and second attempts. (See the Delivery Signature Options section.) If a package still cannot be delivered, we may hold it for two additional business days and may research its status with the sender, recipient, or both, and receive further instruction. After that time, we will return it to the sender as undeliverable.

At our sole discretion, shipments having a declared value of US $\$ 500$ or greater may not be released without a signature even where the release is otherwise authorized.

FedEx may, at its sole discretion, utilize a postal service, an interline cartage agent, a freight forwarding service, or other carrier for pickups and deliveries, which may result in additional transit days and/or service restrictions. Our tender of a shipment to a postal service, an interline cartage agent, a freight forwarding service, or other carrier constitutes delivery of the shipment by us for all purposes.

At the sole discretion of FedEx, some or all of the transportation, handling, and/or service of FedEx shipments may be performed by FedEx, or other carriers as may be selected by FedEx. FedEx will charge the rate applicable to the FedEx service selected by the shipper at the time of tender. The features and services provided by such alternative carriers may differ from those provided by FedEx. In the event FedEx selects another carrier to perform any portion or all of the service selected by the shipper, the remaining terms (or features and services) of FedEx service will continue to be governed by the FedEx terms and conditions contained herein.

Rates quoted will vary depending on whether (1) the shipper is a FedEx account holder and (2) the shipper has discounts applied to his or her account.

- Shippers will be quoted Account-Specific Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, have discounts applied to their account, and if they charge their shipping to their account.
- Shippers will be quoted FedEx Retail Rates for shipments originating in the U.S. that are paid for by cash, check, or debit or credit card instead of being charged to a valid FedEx account.
- Shippers may request FedEx One Rate pricing for qualifying FedEx shipments as an alternative to FedEx Standard List Rates, Account-Specific Rates, or FedEx Retail Rates. See the FedEx One Rate information in the Find Your Rate section of this Service Guide for details.


## Refusal or rejection of shipments

We reserve the right to refuse, hold, or return any shipment and may do so at our sole discretion and without liability to us. We will execute that right when (but not limited to cases in which): (1) the shipment may cause damage or delay to other shipments, property, or personnel; (2) the shipment is likely to sustain damage or loss in transit because of improper or unacceptable packaging or otherwise; (3) the shipment contains any prohibited items; (4) the account of the person or entity responsible for payment is not in good credit standing; (5) when acceptance of the shipment may jeopardize our ability to provide service to other customers; (6) when FedEx is unable to validate the identity of the shipper; or (7) when the shipper, recipient, or any of the parties involved are listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State; the United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority, unless licensed or authorized by the relevant government agency or otherwise permitted under applicable laws. We have no liability whatsoever for refusal or rejection of shipments.

Where required by law, including export controls, sanctions, and customs laws and regulations, FedEx may block or detain any shipment indefinitely and seek government

authorization to return or destroy such shipment, and in such cases shall not be liable for any loss or damages that may result.

## Return options

A. FedEx return options are subject to all other terms and conditions provided in the FedEx claims regulations, and as a whole, these terms and conditions. The contents of a return shipment are subject to the same restrictions and prohibited-item limitations as the original shipment.
B. Written authorization from FedEx is required to participate in the Package Returns Program (PRP) for FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipments. The maximum liability assumed by FedEx for packages returned through PRP, FedEx Print Return Label, or FedEx Email Return Label is limited to $\$ 100$ unless a higher value is declared, up to a maximum of $\$ 1,000$, at time of tender and a greater charge paid (see the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section). The shipper may declare a value up to $\$ 50,000$ for packages returned through the FedEx Ground Call Tag. The declared value of the FedEx Ground Call Tag may not exceed the value of the declared value on the original shipment. The shipper may not declare a value for a package returned by FedEx through a damage call tag. FedEx shall not be liable for any damage to a shipment or claim arising out of the use of a return option unless the package was lost during shipment or there was visible damage noted by the driver at time of delivery. FedEx shall not be liable for any concealed damage for items returned by using PRP, FedEx Print Return Label, or FedEx Email Return Label. Receipt of a shipment without written notice of damage on the delivery record is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. The FedEx liability for any loss or damage arising out of an authorized return shipment shall never exceed the actual amount of damage or the declared amount, whichever is lower. All other terms and conditions shall apply for packages shipped through the use of a FedEx return option.
C. FOR FEDEX RETURNS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE PARTY THAT INITIATES A RETURN SHIPMENT TRANSACTION WITH FEDEX IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND PICKUP FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE SENDER OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY.

## Routing, rerouting, and address correction

FedEx may accept a request to reroute a shipment subject to the following conditions:

1. A special handling charge will be billed to the account number specified on the FedEx airbill for each rerouted package, and it will appear as an address correction on the invoice. This charge will not be applied when a package is changed to Hold at Location and the FedEx location is in the same city as the city on the airbill. Otherwise, the special handling charges will apply. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.
2. To reroute a shipment, the sender or recipient-payer (for U.S. import shipments only) must call 1.800.463.3339 and provide us with a FedEx account number, the FedEx tracking number, the new destination, and a valid contact telephone number for the recipient. A reroute to Hold at Location can also be requested through fedex.com.
3. We may not honor a reroute request from the recipient other than to Hold at Location within the original destination city. Only recipient-payers of U.S. import shipments may request reroutes.
4. Our money-back guarantee policy does not apply to shipments that are rerouted. We have no liability or any remedy for service failure for these shipments.
5. Only one reroute will be allowed per package.
6. We may require photo identification of the person authorized to pick up the package.
7. FedEx may not reroute shipments when Adult Signature Required has been selected or applied as a delivery signature option.
8. Dangerous goods may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intended-recipient's address provided by the shipper, unless dry ice is the only type of dangerous goods contained in the shipment. (Note: All dangerous goods shipments may be made available as hold for pickup at permissible locations or be returned to the sender.)
9. Any requested change to an address that is not a reroute or an address correction is a new shipment, and new shipping charges will apply.
We will determine the routing of all shipments, including the mode of transportation used, and may use air transportation, ground transportation, or any combination thereof in providing our services. We reserve the right to divert any shipment (including use of other carriers) in order to facilitate its delivery. At the sole discretion of FedEx, some or
all of the transportation, handling, and/or service of FedEx shipments may be performed by other carriers as may be selected by FedEx. FedEx will charge the rate applicable to the FedEx service selected by the shipper at the time of tender. The features and services provided by such alternative carriers may differ from those provided by FedEx. In the event FedEx selects another carrier to perform any portion or all of the service selected by the shipper, the remaining terms (or features and services) of FedEx service will continue to be governed by the FedEx Terms and Conditions contained herein.

Note: This section does not apply to requests made by the recipient using FedEx Delivery Manager to request delivery to another address. See FedEx Delivery Manager Terms in the fedex.com Terms of Use.

## Service areas

Service areas are subject to change without notice. For current service area information on selected ZIP codes, go to fedex.com/en-us/online/rating.html.

## Signature releases

A. Shipments with a declared value of less than US $\$ 500$ may be delivered and released without obtaining a signature when the sender has authorized a release or, at our sole option, upon oral or written instruction from the sender or recipient. A shipment may also be released without a signature if the recipient has provided authorization by signing the Release Delivery Authorization and Indemnification Agreement for Recipients (obtained through your local FedEx Ship Center or your FedEx account executive) or online using FedEx Delivery Manager. We may authorize shipments released without signature to those with accounts in good credit standing and to those who otherwise have established a satisfactory payment history. We also reserve the right to release packages at residential delivery locations without obtaining a signature, provided that none of the restrictions below apply.
B. At our sole discretion, some shipments may not be released without a delivery signature even when release is authorized, including, but not limited to:

1. Bill-recipient shipments when the recipient's FedEx account is not in good credit standing or is not indicated on the airbill.
2. Damaged shipments.
3. Dangerous goods or hazardous materials shipments, except those with dry ice as the only dangerous goods in the shipment.
4. Firearms.
5. Indirect deliveries.
6. Shipments billed to an invalid or missing credit card number.
7. Alcohol shipments.
8. One or more packages in a multiple-piece shipment if all packages cannot be safely released.
9. The delivery location or circumstances are unsuitable for release without signature as determined at our sole discretion.
C. At our sole discretion, shipments having a declared value of US $\$ 500$ or greater may not be released without a signature even where the release is otherwise authorized.

## Trailer/vehicle detention

FedEx reserves the right to assess a detention fee when the shipper or recipient fails to load or unload, as applicable, a trailer or vehicle on or near its premises within the allotted time frame or otherwise causes a delay to a FedEx vehicle or hinders our ability to deliver, use, or recover a trailer. Further details on the detention fee will be provided directly to the affected party prior to FedEx charging the fee.

## Undeliverable shipments

An undeliverable shipment is one that cannot be delivered for reasons that include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

- The recipient refuses to pay for a bill-recipient shipment.
- The recipient of a Hold at Location shipment cannot be contacted or the recipient fails to retrieve the shipment.
- The recipient refuses to accept the shipment prior to, during, or after delivery.
- The recipient's delivery address cannot be located.
- The shipment was addressed to an area not served by FedEx.
- The shipment's contents or packaging are damaged to the point that rewrapping is not possible.
- The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

U.S. shipments

## (Undeliverable shipments, cont.)

- The shipment contains prohibited items.
- The recipient's place of business is closed.
- No appropriate person was available to accept the shipment at a delivery location on the initial delivery attempt or reattempts.
- The shipment was improperly packaged.
- The shipper, recipient, or any other party involved in the shipment is listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State; the United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority, and the shipment is not licensed or otherwise authorized by the relevant government agency.
- FedEx is unable to identify the shipper and/or recipient information.
A. Undeliverable shipments may be returned at the payer's expense. Shipments will be returned at no additional charge if the shipment is undeliverable because of damage to the shipment caused by FedEx. However, if the shipment is undeliverable for any other reason, FedEx reserves the right to assess return transportation charges and fees to the original payer, along with the original transportation charges and fees.
B. At our sole discretion, we may contact the sender for instructions on returning or otherwise disposing of the shipment. The charges associated with the original shipment remain due and payable within 15 days from the invoice date. If a package is marked "Bill Recipient" and is refused or returned to the sender, the billing is automatically changed to "Bill Sender."
C. If the shipment is undeliverable for any other reason, all return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper, along with the original transportation charges and fees.

If a FedEx Express Freight shipment is marked "Bill Recipient" and is refused or returned to the sender, the billing is automatically changed to "Bill Sender."

All FedEx Express Freight shipments will be returned via FedEx 3Day Freight. The freight shipment will be returned at no additional charge if the freight shipment is undeliverable because of a service failure. If the shipper requests return via another service, our regular rates will apply. If the freight shipment is undeliverable because of a non-service-failure reason, all return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper, along with the original transportation charges and fees.
D. Dangerous goods shipments will only be returned via FedEx Dangerous Goods Service or other appropriate means. A dangerous goods special handling fee applies. The shipper must supply a completed return airbill and all other required documentation.
E. FedEx reserves the right, at its sole discretion, and without notice, to sell, destroy, or otherwise dispose of undeliverable shipments. By tendering a shipment, the shipper agrees to transfer and convey good and sufficient title of the contents of undeliverable shipments to FedEx, and agrees to pay any costs incurred in the sale, destruction, or disposal thereof.

## Warranties

WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES.

## Non-waiver

Any failure by us to enforce or apply a term, condition, or provision of the FedEx Service Guide does not constitute a waiver of that term, condition, or provision and does not otherwise impair our right to enforce such term, condition, or provision.

## Account numbers

All shipments originating in the U.S. and paid for with cash, check, or debit or credit card must be tendered at a staffed shipping location, and will be charged FedEx Retail Rates.

For transactions other than "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party," you must pay by cash (not accepted at all FedEx locations), check, money order, or credit card. Payment is required when you give us your package. For "Bill Sender" and "Bill Third Party" transactions, packages will not be accepted unless you provide a valid FedEx account number.

For "Bill Recipient" transactions, packages can be tendered without payment, but in order for the package to be delivered, the recipient must provide a valid FedEx account number or pay with cash, check, money order, or credit card (if accepted as a form of payment in the destination country) at time of delivery. If the recipient or third party refuses to pay any transportation charges and other fees, including, but not limited to, duties and taxes, the package will be treated as undeliverable and the sender will be responsible for all transportation charges and other fees, including all special handling fees and duties and taxes.

For customers utilizing our electronic shipping systems, a valid FedEx account number is required for "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party" transactions.

Account numbers are issued by FedEx according to shipping location and are nontransferable. Account numbers are issued and used solely at the discretion of FedEx. FedEx may discontinue the use of accounts, in whole or in part, and terminate all or particular accounts and account numbers at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Improper, illegal, or any other misuse of your FedEx account may also, at the sole discretion of FedEx, result in loss of discounts or termination of the account. Improper, illegal, or other misuse includes, but is not limited to, ordering supplies for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, unauthorized consolidation of shipments owned by different parties, or violations of the terms and conditions in this FedEx Service Guide. If your account has been compromised or stolen, the account may be closed and you may be issued a new account. However, you will be responsible for all valid charges on the closed account. Any supplies, materials, rights, or privileges that you acquire by holding a FedEx account number may not be used for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, and FedEx may seek damages against you for any improper, illegal, or other misuse of your account. If your account is terminated, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny your application for new or additional FedEx account numbers at any time in the future. Except for Canada- and Puerto Rico-based accounts, international account numbers may not be used for shipments between two points within the U.S. All charges will be billed and must be remitted in U.S. funds.

Any individual or entity that uses the FedEx account or shipping discounts of another FedEx account holder without authorization will be charged Standard List Rates for all such shipments without prior notice. This includes all shipments, whether they are classified as "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party," or any other method of billing. Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, using the shipping discount of another FedEx account holder without the knowledge and permission of both FedEx and the account holder.

All requests for account numbers are subject to credit investigation and verification by our Credit Department and Customer Account Confirmation Department. FedEx utilizes business credit reporting agencies, audited financial statements, Standard \& Poor's and Moody's bond ratings, and other sources as necessary, to determine eligibility for open credit terms. FedEx does not offer consumer credit privileges. Any individual shipping for personal use must prepay the shipment charges or establish a FedEx account for billing directly to a major credit card. Stored-value cards or gift cards cannot be used to open an account; however, such cards may be used for payment when tendering a package at staffed FedEx shipping locations, and in conjunction with our credit card acceptance policy. If your FedEx account is billed directly to a credit card, you agree to the following terms: (1) you authorize FedEx to initiate variable charges to the credit card to settle charges payable to FedEx; (2) you authorize FedEx to charge your card for any unpaid amounts on your account; (3) you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts associated with your account without requiring a signed receipt; (4) you agree to keep your card information current (FedEx may receive updates on your card information from participating issuing banks and may update your account profile to avoid service disruptions); (5) you agree that FedEx shall have no liability for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred from attempts to charge and/or place holds on your card; and (6) your agreement to these terms and conditions is to be accepted as authorization to the card issuer to pay all amounts associated with your account.

The party to whom a FedEx account number is issued is liable for all charges to the account, including those resulting from unauthorized use. The account holder is responsible for the safekeeping of the account number. The account number should be released only to those authorized to ship on the account.

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Account numbers, cont.)

Failure to keep your FedEx account current may result in your account being placed on a cash-only status. Use of an account on cash-only status may result in your package being delayed, rejected, or returned until arrangements for payment are completed. If the account number to be billed is not valid, the shipment may be refused, delayed, or returned until an alternative form of payment is secured. If a package is held, returned, or delivery is otherwise delayed because the account is not in good credit standing, you will not be entitled to a refusal or credit of your transportation charges under the Service Failure Money-Back Guarantee Policy.

You must use your FedEx account number to obtain any discount applicable to your account. Use of your account number constitutes your agreement that all packages and freight shipped via FedEx international services shall be subject to these terms and conditions, as modified, amended, or supplemented.

FedEx may provide trade credit information on its account holders to credit bureaus.

## Alcoholic beverages

Only licensed entities holding appropriate licenses as required by their jurisdiction may ship alcohol with FedEx. Individuals may not ship alcohol. U.S.-based shippers must enter into an approved FedEx Alcohol Shipping Agreement before shipping any alcohol with FedEx. For more information, go to fedex.com/en-us/shipping/alcohol.html or contact your FedEx account executive. FedEx International Ground and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments to or from Canada may not contain alcoholic beverages. A clearance service fee may apply if your shipment requires special import clearance processing; see fedex.com for more information.

For U.S. Import: FedEx will not accept shipments of alcohol (beer, wine, or spirits) to nonlicensed parties located in the U.S. from an international location. FedEx will accept shipments of alcohol (beer, wine, and spirits) inbound to the U.S. when both the shipper and recipient are licensed entities. For more information, go to fedex.com/en-us/ shipping/alcohol.html. The shipper must hold a license from the country of origin issued in accordance with that country's law and regulations. The recipient, located in the U.S., is required to hold: (1) a basic permit for importer and/or wholesaler issued from the U.S. Department of Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), and (2) if applicable, a wholesaler, dealer, distributor, or manufacturer license issued from the state in which the recipient is located.

For U.S. Export: FedEx will accept alcohol shipments for export from the U.S. when both the shipper and recipient are licensed entities, and wine shipments from licensed entities directly to consumers in a limited number of countries, subject to additional requirements and all applicable laws and regulations. For more information, go to fedex.com/en-us/ shipping/alcohol.html. Shippers located in the U.S. must hold: (1) a basic permit for importer and/or wholesaler issued from the TTB, and (2) if applicable, a wholesaler, dealer, distributor, retailer, or manufacturer license issued from the state in which the shipper is located.

Contact your FedEx account executive for complete details.

## Billing

A. "Bill Sender" means the specified charges will be billed to the sender. The sender's FedEx account number must appear in the appropriate section of the air waybill, and the account should be current. FedEx International Next Flight shipments may only be shipped "Bill Sender" and "Bill Third Party," but all charges must be verified (for U.S. accounts only). For duty-and-tax charges, "Bill Sender" means the sender will be invoiced for applicable duties and taxes and additional clearance service fees incurred.
B. "Bill Recipient" means the specified charges will be billed to the recipient. In order to choose this billing option, the recipient's valid FedEx account number must appear on the air waybill before it is delivered and payment on the account must be current, or the recipient must pay for the package at time of delivery. If the recipient is billed initially and refuses to make payment for the shipment, the charges may be rebilled to a third party. If not paid by the third party, any additional rebilling must be to the sender's account. The sender is liable for, and will be billed for, all charges and fees in the event the recipient or any third party does not pay.
C. "Bill Third Party" means the specified charges will be billed to someone other than the sender or recipient. In order to choose this billing option, the third party's valid FedEx account number must be entered in the appropriate section of the air waybill and must be in good credit standing. The sender is liable for, and will be billed for, all charges and fees in the event the recipient or any third party does not pay. If the third party refuses to pay, the transportation charges will automatically be billed to the sender and duties and taxes to the recipient. If the third party does not have credit arrangements with FedEx, the sender will automatically be billed.
D. Invoices for transportation charges are payable within 15 days of the invoice date. Invoices for duties and taxes are payable upon receipt.
E. We reserve the right to verify the method of payment for any shipment and to refuse any shipment for which the method of payment cannot be verified.
F. FedEx may consider payment type in determining pricing and discounts, and reserves the right to adjust discounts based on payment type.
G. Payer Rebilling. At our sole discretion, we may accept requests to change billing instructions from the shipper or current bill-to party up to 90 days from the current invoice date. FedEx must receive prior approval from the new bill-to party for:

- Transportation charges being rebilled to a consignee or third party when not due to a FedEx billing error.
- Duty-and-tax charges being rebilled to the shipper if originally billed to the consignee and not due to a FedEx billing error.
- Duty-and-tax charges being rebilled to the consignee or third party when not due to a FedEx billing error.
Requests for rebilling of transportation charges must be received via one of the approved channels:

1. Submit your request through the Non-Pay option with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) if you are a registered user; or
2. Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or
3. Submit your request via fedex.com/en-us/customer-support.html (select Billing/ Invoicing as the category). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number, amount and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill; or
4. Submit the request via our automated interactive voice response system at 1.800.463.3339 (say "billing"). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include your FedEx account number, if any, the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number, and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill.
H. Billing and Special Handling Fees:
5. A special handling fee will be charged where no account number appears on the air waybill or where an incomplete, inaccurate, or invalid account number appears on the air waybill in "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party" transactions. If a "Bill Sender," "Bill Recipient," or "Bill Third Party" package is received without a FedEx account number, we will attempt to determine the correct account from our records and bill the account for all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee. Any applicable discount will apply. If, however, we cannot determine the correct account, the transportation charges plus the special handling fee will be billed directly to the sender and no discount will be allowed. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.
6. A US\$20 special handling fee will be charged to you for any check or electronic funds transfer that is dishonored for any reason.
7. Duties and taxes may be assessed on the contents of shipments destined for international locations. If we disburse duties and taxes to a customs agency on behalf of the payer, the payer may be assessed a clearance service fee based on a flat rate or a percentage of the total amount disbursed (whichever is greater). See the Duties and Taxes section for details.
J. Electronically captured data will be used for billing purposes in the event a billing copy of the air waybill is not available at the time of billing.
K. Charges in freely convertible currencies other than U.S. dollars are billed to the payer's account. Charges requiring conversion to a currency other than U.S. dollars will be calculated daily using the median bid price obtained from OANDA, an internet exchangerate service, except for those currencies where the customary practice is to use local bank rates to convert currency for payers in that country. The median bid price is the average price at which buyers offer to buy currencies from sellers during the given period. These currency conversion rates can be accessed at www.oanda.com.

The currency-conversion rate in effect one day prior to the ship date will be used for conversions to non-hyper-inflationary currencies. However, we reserve the right to use the exchange rate at invoice date, as opposed to shipment date, in countries where the currency is volatile.

There is an additional exchange fee of $1.75 \%$ for conversion from any non-U.S. currency to U.S. dollars, $2.3 \%$ for U.S. dollars to any currency, and $2.0 \%$ between all non-U.S. currency conversions. The currencies of participating European Union countries will have stationary conversion rates to the euro. There is no exchange fee between currencies related to the euro. Charges in currencies other than the U.S. dollars that are
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Billing, cont.)

not freely convertible will be converted to U.S. dollars and billed to the payer's account either at the free-market rate or at the official rate at which FedEx was permitted to purchase U.S. dollars in the relevant currency, at our sole option.
L. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE SENDER IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES AND ANY DUTIES OR TAXES WHICH WE HAVE DISBURSED, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE RECIPIENT OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY. For FedEx Global Returns shipments, please see Return and Import Shipping Options. M. Your payment must be accompanied by the remittance data that supports the payment. Remittance data must include the FedEx invoice number and the associated amount(s) being paid on the FedEx invoice. Payment at the airbill level or tracking number level must be transmitted to FedEx via electronic data interchange (EDI) â see the EDI section below.

P. Invoice Adjustments/Overcharges:

1. We reserve the right to audit shipments to verify service selection, shipment weight, and dimensions. Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package's dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the service selected, weight entered, or dimensions entered are incorrect or change during transit, we may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time.
2. Default Billing. Senders are solely responsible for (i) accurately completing all sections of the air waybill, (ii) accurately entering shipment information into any electronic shipping device, and (iii) providing original shipping labels with a unique tracking number for each package in a shipment. If you fail to provide or correctly enter this information and documentation, you will be billed and agree to pay based on our estimate of the number of packages transported and either the dimensional weight at the time of billing or a standard default weight-perpackage estimate, both of which will be determined by us at our sole discretion. If no service is marked, we will send your shipment via FedEx International Priority Express, FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Economy, FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy Freight, or FedEx International Deferred Freight service as selected by us at our sole discretion.

For FedEx International Priority Express, FedEx International Priority, and FedEx International Economy services, the recipient's postal code is critical to correct invoicing (to those countries that are in multiple rate scales). Any omission or incorrect entry will result in a billing based on a default postal code.
3. Our money-back guarantee policy governs and is the exclusive remedy for requests for refunds or credits related to service failures. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for applicable notice provisions and other conditions.) If the money-back guarantee is suspended or revoked, there is no remedy.
4. Requests for invoice adjustments due to an overcharge must be received within 60 days after the original invoice date (or ship date if prepaid by cash, check, money order, or credit card).
5. FedEx account holders are responsible for timely monitoring charges to their accounts and are deemed on notice of charges once they have been invoiced. A FedEx account holder requesting invoice adjustment due to unauthorized account use or fraud (a "Fraud Dispute") must immediately notify FedEx of the activity on the affected account(s) upon discovery of unauthorized activity. FedEx, in its sole discretion, will determine if the proof submitted by the party requesting an invoice adjustment is sufficient to establish that the disputed charges were not authorized.

Any FedEx account holder making a Fraud Dispute must submit that Fraud Dispute to FedEx within 30 days of receiving the contested invoice (or within 30 days of the ship date if prepaid by cash, check, money order, or credit card). All suspected fraudulent activity related to a FedEx account must be submitted to the Fraud and Security Controls team at 1.800.584.2681.
6. FedEx is not obligated to refund any overcharge or pay any other obligation owed when your FedEx account is, or has been in the past, more than 60 days past due.
7. If your account is more than 60 days past due, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, apply any overcharge amounts or other overpayments it agrees are owed to you against the oldest invoices.
8. You may request an invoice adjustment for reasons not related to a service failure in the following ways:

We pay any applicable excise tax on the air transportation portion of our service. R. The shipper and any other party who is liable for payment are responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest, and court costs.
S. At our sole discretion, FedEx may transfer and assign ownership of, and any rights to collect, any and all charges due and payable to us.

## Cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and data logging devices

1. Any cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices (collectively "Device(s)") shipped with FedEx must first be reviewed and approved by FedEx prior to use on any shipment with FedEx. Only those Devices that have been explicitly approved by FedEx may be utilized. For details on Device approval and proper shipping guidelines and requirements, contact your FedEx Sales Representative.
2. Customers must notify FedEx in advance about the inclusion of any cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logging device for every shipment containing said Device. Customers must declare the use of any Device when making a booking and must include the brand, type, model, and ID number of the device on the Air Waybill in accordance with the instructions from FedEx.
3. Customer is solely responsible for and shall fully comply with all applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and orders related to usage of cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices. Customer must also obtain all applicable licenses or permits required to use any given cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices and Customer shall tender to FedEx such license or permit upon request by FedEx.
4. All cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices shipped with FedEx must be installed in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer and FedEx. Cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices must be securely attached to, or enclosed within, the package or container being shipped. FedEx is not responsible for any damage to, or loss of cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices shipped with FedEx.
5. FedEx shall not be responsible for identifying or interpreting any applicable laws or regulations that may affect Customer's shipments containing a cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices, nor shall FedEx have any liability to Customer where FedEx may comply with instructions or requests from applicable
law enforcement or other governmental authorities, regardless if such instructions are inconsistent or contrary to any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order.
6. Customer is solely responsible for identifying and gathering appropriate written approvals of countries and/or jurisdictions that the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device is permitted to enter and operate within. Customer shall immediately tender such written approvals to FedEx upon FedEx request. Customer shall only use the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device with shipments that are to and from jurisdictions where permitted by applicable law, and Customer shall be fully liable for any wrongful shipments or any claims arising out of a cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device entering any country and/or jurisdiction that the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device is not permitted to enter, even if the shipment is misdirected or incorrectly routed.
7. Customer shall be solely responsible for any country/customs taxes or fees that may be levied on the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device contained within any shipment. Furthermore, Customer understands and agrees that Customer shall be responsible for all logistics and costs for returning the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device to the appropriate personnel, provided the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device is/are not disposable. If the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device is disposable, Customer is solely responsible for the proper disposal of the Device(s).
8. Any data acquired through usage of the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices within FedEx shipments will be used only for Customer's internal quality, security, or tracking purposes. Customer shall not share any data acquired through usage of the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices with any third party, except as permitted in an appropriate mutual non-disclosure agreement between FedEx, Customer, and the third party.
9. Customer (including any affiliate) shall not advertise or promote itself or the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger devices using the name, service mark or description of FedEx or any of its affiliates, without the written consent of FedEx in the case of each such use.
10. Customer's usage of the cargo monitoring, cargo tracking, and/or data logger device must conform with and will follow all:
a. Foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory guidance including, but not limited to, civil aviation authorities, telecommunications authorities, and works council approvals;

## Carriage under international conventions

A. As used in the FedEx terms and conditions, "Montreal Convention" means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Montreal, May 28, 1999. "Warsaw Convention" means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw, Oct. 12, 1929, or that convention as amended, including the Montreal Protocol No. 4. "Carrier" includes the air carrier issuing the air waybill and all air carriers that carry the goods or perform any other services related to the carriage.
B. When the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Montreal Convention or Warsaw Convention may be applicable. The convention governs and, in most cases, limits our liability for loss of, damage to, or delay of cargo.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Carriage under international conventions, cont.)

C. The Montreal Convention and the Warsaw Convention limit our liability for loss or delay of or damage to your shipment, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee as described below. The interpretation of the relevant Convention's liability limit may vary depending on the destination country. If the Montreal Convention applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 26 SDRs per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. If the Warsaw Convention as amended by Montreal Protocol No. 4 applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 17 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. Otherwise, our liability is limited to US $\$ 9.07$ per pound (US $\$ 20.00$ per kilo) unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee.
D. To the extent not in conflict with the rules relating to liability for international carriage as established by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention, carriage and other services performed by us are subject to the provisions of the FedEx Service Guide and applicable tariffs as amended from time to time, which are incorporated in the FedEx Service Guide by reference. The tariffs, if any, may be inspected at our corporate headquarters in Memphis, Tenn.
E. FedEx assumes no obligation to carry the goods by any specified aircraft or over any particular route or to make connections at any point according to any schedules. You agree FedEx may, without notice, substitute alternative carrier or aircraft, deviate from the route or routes, or cause the goods to be transported by motor vehicle.

THERE ARE NO STOPPING PLACES THAT ARE AGREED TO AT THE TIME OF TENDER OF THE SHIPMENT, AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ROUTE THE SHIPMENT IN ANY WAY WE DEEM APPROPRIATE.

## Cartage agents

We provide pickup and delivery to many international locations.
A. If you elect to make arrangements for pickup or delivery directly with a cartage agent, you are responsible for all charges and fees assessed by the cartage agent. The invoice you receive from us will reflect only our charges and fees.
B. Our delivery commitment time and money-back guarantee policy apply only to the portion of the transportation handled directly by us. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section.) The delivery commitment time begins when the cartage agent tenders the shipment to us and ends when a shipment is available for pickup by you or a cartage agent. Our tender of a shipment to a cartage agent constitutes delivery of the shipment by us for all purposes. We are not responsible for service failures as a result of cartage agent pickups or deliveries.
C. A special handling fee applies; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide.
D. Cartage agents are independent contractors. They are neither employees nor agents of FedEx, and we are not responsible for any of their acts or omissions.

## Claims

A. We must receive notice of a claim due to damage (visible or concealed), delay (including spoilage claims), or shortage within 21 calendar days after delivery of the shipment. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for the time period to request a refund or credit of transportation charges due to a service failure.) We must receive notice of all other claims, including, but not limited to, claims for nondelivery or misdelivery, within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx for shipment.
B. Notice of claims for which you are seeking more than US $\$ 100$ must be in writing. All claims must be made within the time limits set forth above.
C. Your notice of claim must include complete shipper and recipient information, as well as the FedEx tracking number, date of shipment, number of pieces, and shipment weight. Failure to provide us with notice in the manner and within the time limits set forth in paragraphs (A) through (B) will result in denial of your claim, and we will have no liability or obligation to pay your claim. The filing of a lawsuit does not constitute compliance with these notice provisions.
D. Written documentation supporting the amount of your claim must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx for shipment. Such documentation may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair, expense statements, appraisals, final confirmation screen if online order with proof of purchase, or other records. These documents must be verifiable to our satisfaction.
E. We are not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges have been paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or from any outstanding balance owed to us.
F. FedEx reserves the right to inspect a damaged shipment on the recipient's premises as well as the right to retrieve the damaged package for inspection at a FedEx facility. The terms and conditions applicable to the original shipment (including any declared value)
will govern the disposition of all claims in connection with the shipment, including any claim relative to the retrieval, inspection, or return of the package. When a package is picked up for inspection, a receipt for the damaged package will be provided if requested by the recipient. All of the original shipping cartons, packing, and contents must be made available for our inspection and retained until the claim is concluded. FedEx reserves the right to request a self-inspection requiring proof of damage in the form of photographs of the carton, inner packaging, and damaged contents. If requested, this documentation must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx for shipment.
G. Except in the case of concealed damage, receipt of the shipment by the recipient without written notice of damage on the air waybill is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition.
H. We do not accept claims from customers whose packages were sent through a package consolidator. (See the Package Consolidators section.)
I. Shipment-status information is not intended or permitted to be used as the basis to file a claim.
J. Only one claim can be filed in connection with a shipment. Acceptance of payment of a claim shall extinguish any right to recover in connection with that shipment.
K. In the event that a sender requests FedEx to bill the recipient or a third party for a shipment, and the payer agreed to waive or otherwise limit its right to submit claims, the payer's waiver or other limitation will be imputed to the sender.
L. If the party filing the claim is not the shipper or the payor of transportation charges to FedEx, customers must obtain and provide a claim filing waiver from the shipper (on company letterhead if the shipper is a company).
M. When we resolve a claim by paying full value for a shipment, we reserve the right to pick up the package for salvage, and all rights, title to, and interest in the package shall vest with us.
N. You can file a claim in the following ways:

1. Submit claims online at fedex.com/en-us/customer-support/claims.html for U.S. export shipments to all countries served by FedEx and U.S.-inbound shipments from Canada.
2. Call customer service at 1.800.463.3339 (say "Claims") to obtain a case number for your claim. All supporting documents, including the additional claim form sent via email, must be submitted via the online portal at fedex.com/claimdocuments.
O. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN THE DENIAL OF YOUR CLAIM.

## Collect on delivery (C.O.D.) service: not offered

We do not offer C.O.D. service to international destinations. A shipment marked "C.O.D." will be returned and all related charges will be billed to the sender.

## Credit terms

A. We do not provide individual consumer credit privileges.
B. As a condition of extending credit privileges, FedEx reserves the right to require business customers to provide current financial information, agree to bank draft arrangements for payment on account, provide a security deposit or provide a bank letter of credit.
C. When credit privileges are extended, FedEx reserves the right to establish and enforce a credit limit on your account. At our sole discretion, we may review and amend a credit limit on your account.
D. The invoice date begins the credit term cycle, and payment for transportation charges is due within 15 days from the invoice date. A late payment fee will be assessed if your payment and required remittance data that supports the payment is not received by FedEx by the invoice due date. The late payment fee will equal $8 \%$ of the total past-due balance of any invoice that is past due. Failure to keep your FedEx account current will result in your account being placed on cash-only status. This status may impair your ability to use our services, delay your shipments, and may result in the loss of any applicable discounts. Duties, taxes, and other fees are payable immediately upon receipt of our invoice. If transportation charges and duties and taxes are on the same invoice, all charges are due upon receipt of invoice.

## Customs clearance

A. All shipments that cross international borders must be cleared through customs. The sender is responsible for making sure goods are shipped in compliance with all customs regulatory requirements, for providing all documentation and information required for the clearance, and for representing and warrantying that all statements and information it provides relating to the goods and the clearance of the shipment are and continue to be true, correct, and complete, including the appropriate Harmonized Tariff Schedule Code. Shipments requiring documentation in addition to the FedEx International Air Waybill, or the FedEx International Next Flight Air Waybill (e.g., a commercial invoice) may require additional transit time. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION TO CHARGE YOU WITH ANY PENALTIES, FINES, DAMAGES OR OTHER COSTS OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STORAGE FEES, RESULTING FROM AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION BY ANY COMPETENT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY, OR BY YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS HEREBY LAID OUT.
B. The sender is responsible at its own expense for making sure goods shipped internationally are acceptable for entry into the destination country and comply with all licensing or permitting requirements when applicable.
C. You may also be required to provide additional information to obtain clearance from other regulatory agencies in the destination country prior to delivery to the recipient. Shipments that contain goods or products that are regulated by multiple government agencies within the destination country (such as the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S. and comparable agencies in the destination country) may require additional time for clearance. All charges for shipment to and return from countries where entry is not permitted are the sender's responsibility.
D. When shipments are held by customs or other agencies due to incorrect or missing documentation, we may attempt to notify the recipient. If local law requires the correct information or documentation to be submitted by the recipient and the recipient fails to do so within a reasonable time as we may determine, the shipment may be considered undeliverable. (See the Undeliverable Shipments section.) If the recipient fails to supply the required information or documentation, and local law allows the sender to provide the same, we may attempt to notify the sender. If the sender also fails to provide the information or documentation within a reasonable time as we may determine, the shipment will be considered undeliverable. We assume no responsibility for our inability to complete a delivery due to incorrect or missing documentation, whether or not we attempt to notify the recipient or sender.
E. Where permissible by local law and unless instructed otherwise (e.g., via "FedEx International Broker Select," described below), we will provide customs clearance of your international shipments, acting in the name of and on behalf of the receiver for the sole purpose of clearing the goods through customs. FedEx will submit your shipment information to customs and other regulatory agencies for clearance. FedEx may charge a clearance service fee, where applicable, on international shipments for
clearance processing, for disbursing duties and taxes to a customs agency on behalf of the payer, for services requested by the sender, recipient, or importer of record, or to recover the costs passed to FedEx by the regulatory agency for regulatory filing. The types and amounts of fees vary by country. (See fedex.com/en-us/ancillary-clearance-service.html for a list of clearance service fees in your destination country.)
F. FedEx will not disburse or bill any duties and taxes if the FedEx International Broker Select service has been selected. The Saturday Delivery service option is not available for FedEx International Broker Select shipments. Commodity acceptability and restrictions when using FedEx International Broker Select vary by country. Please contact FedEx Customer Service for destination requirements.
G. In some instances, at our option, we accept instructions to use a designated customs broker other than FedEx (or the broker selected by FedEx) or the broker designated by the shipper. In any event, FedEx (or the broker selected by FedEx) reserves the right to clear the shipment if the broker cannot be determined or will not perform clearance, or if complete broker information is not provided (including name, address, phone number, and postal code).
H. For shipments that must be cleared through customs by the recipient, FedEx will deliver the customs paperwork to the recipient, and delivery of paperwork constitutes timely delivery.
I. If acceptable wildlife products are shipped via the FedEx International Broker Select service option for U.S. import, they must be addressed to a broker at one of the 18 designated U.S. Fish and Wildlife ports.
J. U.S. import shipments that contain products that originate from wildlife or contain wildlife may require original permits/certificates (CITES) for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service clearance. U.S. importers of wildlife products must obtain an import license from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for commercial shipments.
K. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires completion of FDA Prior Notice for certain shipments containing food or food articles for human or animal consumption prior to their arrival in the U.S. A copy of the FDA Prior Notice confirmation record must be included with the shipping documentation for all foods and food products that require Prior Notice.

All current fees apply.
F. Each shipment must be accompanied by the 8-1/2 x11" Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form when required.

All batteries transported under Special Provision A88 or A99 must be preapproved. Email AB8A99approvalrequest@fedex.com to begin the process.
H. FedEx may require shippers to hire a trained pack-and-ship vendor to resolve a problem with an undeliverable dangerous goods shipment. If the recipient refuses a package or freight piece containing dangerous goods, or the package leaks or is damaged, it will be returned to the shipper if possible. If the shipper refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and agrees to reimburse and otherwise indemnify FedEx for all costs, fees, and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup and disposal of the package or freight piece. The shipper agrees to indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees, and expenses FedEx incurs as a result of the shipper's failure to comply with FedEx Dangerous Goods shipping requirements.
I. We have the right to refuse any package or freight piece with an odor or any package that is wet or leaking. If a dangerous goods shipment damages or contaminates any property, the shipper is solely responsible for and will reimburse and indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees, and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup of such damage or contamination.
J. Not all FedEx locations accept dangerous goods, and we reserve the right to refuse dangerous goods at any location where they cannot be accepted in accordance with applicable law. Dangerous goods shipments, including dry ice, are not allowed at FedEx Drop Box locations, FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations, FedEx Authorized ShipCenter locations, FedEx OnSite locations, or FedEx ShipSite locations, except as noted below. 1.

Note: We are required by law to report improperly declared or undeclared shipments of dangerous goods to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The shipper may be subject to fines and penalties under applicable law. The DOT/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires every shipper to have job-specific dangerous goods training prior to tendering a dangerous goods shipment to FedEx or another air carrier. When individuals tender a shipment containing dangerous goods it must be properly classified, packaged, marked, labeled, and identified as dangerous goods, and include the correct dangerous goods documentation.
M. Dangerous goods may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intendedrecipient's address provided by the shipper, unless dry ice is the only type of dangerous goods contained in the shipment. (Note: All dangerous goods shipments may be made available as hold for pickup at permissible locations or be returned to the sender.)
N. We are required to maintain proper segregation of incompatible dangerous goods on all vehicles and aircraft. This necessity may cause the shipment to move on the next available truck route or flight on which proper segregation can be maintained.

## Declared value for carriage and limits of liability (not insurance coverage)

The declared value for carriage of any package represents our maximum liability in connection with a shipment of that package, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the shipment. It is the shipper's responsibility to prove actual damages. Exposure to and risk of any loss in excess of the declared value is assumed by the shipper. You may transfer this risk to an insurance carrier of your choice through the purchase of an insurance policy. Contact an insurance agent or broker if you desire insurance coverage. WE DO NOT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ANY KIND.
A. If for any reason the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention (see the Carriage Under International Conventions section) does not govern our liability, our
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Declared value for carriage and limits of liability, cont.)

maximum liability for loss, damage, or delay, or any claim with regard to any shipment moving to or from the U.S. is limited to US $\$ 100$, US $\$ 9.07$ per pound, or US $\$ 20.00$ per kilo, whichever is greater, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay a greater charge. The interpretation of the relevant Convention's liability limit may vary depending on the destination country. If the Montreal Convention applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 26 SDRs per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. If the Warsaw Convention as amended by Montreal Protocol No. 4 applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 17 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. Otherwise, our liability is limited to US $\$ 9.07$ per pound (US $\$ 20.00$ per kilo) unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee.

FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy Freight, and FedEx International Deferred Freight shipments have a maximum declared-value limit of US $\$ 100,000$ to most destinations. FedEx International Broker Select shipments to many countries are allowed to exceed the country declared-value-for-carriage limit (but not the FedEx International Priority Express, FedEx International Priority, and FedEx International Economy maximum of US $\$ 50,000$ per shipment). FedEx International Ground and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments to Canada have a maximum declared value limit of US $\$ 50,000$. FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution and FedEx International Economy DirectDistribution have a maximum of US $\$ 50,000$ per piece within a consolidated shipment.

Except as limited below, unless a higher value is declared and paid for, our liability for each package shipped between Puerto Rico and the U.S. is limited to US $\$ 100$. For each package exceeding US $\$ 100$ in declared value, an additional amount will be charged. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.

Except as limited below, the declared-value limit for shipments between Puerto Rico and the U.S. is US $\$ 50,000$ per shipment, rather than US $\$ 50,000$ per package.

For packages shipped between Puerto Rico and the U.S., or sent to any international location, the declared value for carriage cannot be greater than the declared value for customs. A FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelope and FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ Pak to and from Puerto Rico is limited to a declared value for customs and carriage of US $\$ 100$.
B. If you declare a higher value for carriage, an additional amount will be assessed for each US $\$ 100$ (or fraction thereof) by which the declared value for carriage exceeds the US $\$ 100$ or US $\$ 9.07$ per-pound liability limitation, whichever is applicable. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details. EVEN IF A HIGHER VALUE IS DECLARED, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR DELAY OF A SHIPMENT WILL NOT EXCEED ITS REPAIR COSTS, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.
C. For the contents of a FedEx Envelope or a FedEx Pak, regardless of destination, the maximum declared value for customs is US $\$ 500$ and the maximum declared value for carriage is US $\$ 100$ or US $\$ 9.07$ per pound, whichever is greater. Goods with a value (actual or declared) exceeding US $\$ 500$ should not be shipped in a FedEx Envelope or FedEx Pak. D. The maximum declared value for customs and carriage for a FedEx international shipment, if other than a FedEx Envelope or FedEx Pak, can be found at fedex.com under the individual country listing.

Except as limited below, the maximum declared value per shipment for FedEx International Next Flight is US $\$ 50,000$. If a FedEx International Next Flight shipment is tendered to FedEx palletized or shrink wrapped as one single unit, the maximum declared value is US $\$ 50,000$. If more than one FedEx International Next Flight package is shipped on one air waybill, the declared value for carriage of each package will be determined by dividing the total declared value for carriage by the number of packages in the shipment; the liability of FedEx for loss or damage will be limited to the actual value of the package(s) lost or damaged, not to exceed the per-package declared value. E. Shipments (packages or freight) containing all or part of the following items are limited to a maximum declared value for carriage of US $\$ 1,000$ per shipment or US $\$ 9.07$ per pound, whichever is greater. Import of any of the following items may be prohibited by individual countries, and a lower declared-value limitation for a country will control this stated limitation for such items.

1. Artwork, including any work created or developed by the application of skill, taste, or creative talent for sale, display, or collection. This includes, but is not limited to, items (and their parts) such as paintings, drawings, vases, tapestries, limited-edition prints, fine art, statuary, sculpture, and collector's items.
2. Film, photographic images (including photographic negatives), photographic chromes, and photographic slides.
3. Any commodity that by its inherent nature is particularly susceptible to damage or the market value of which is particularly variable or difficult to ascertain.

13. Guitars and other musical instruments that are more than 20 years old, and customized or personalized musical instruments.
14. Scale models (including, but not limited to, architectural models and dollhouses) and prototypes.
F. The declared value for carriage cannot be greater than the declared value for customs.
G. When the sender has not specified the declared value for carriage of each package on an air waybill, but has specified a total declared value for all packages, the declared value for each package will be determined by dividing the total declared value by the number of packages on the air waybill unless you provide verifiable evidence supporting a different allocation. The declared value of any package in a shipment cannot exceed the declared value of the total shipment.
H. Notwithstanding anything else in the FedEx Service Guide, we are not liable for any loss of, damage to, or delay, misdelivery, or nondelivery of unacceptable shipments, including, but not limited to, cash or currency, nor misdelivery of information.
I. Notwithstanding anything else in the FedEx Service Guide, we are not liable for any loss, damage, or delay to any package that is not adequately packaged by the shipper. J. ANY EFFORT TO DECLARE A VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUMS ALLOWED IN THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE IS NULL AND VOID. OUR ACCEPTANCE FOR CARRIAGE OF ANY SHIPMENT BEARING A DECLARED VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWED MAXIMUMS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY PROVISION OF THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE AS TO SUCH SHIPMENT.
K. REGARDLESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE OF A PACKAGE, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION, ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, OR MISDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, WILL NOT EXCEED A SHIPMENT'S REPAIR COST, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.
L. The shipper is responsible for accurately completing the air waybill or other shipping documents, including completion of the declared-value section. We cannot honor requests to change the declared-value information on the air waybill after tender to FedEx.
M. See the Liabilities Not Assumed section for other limitations and exclusions on our liability.
N. Additional restrictions may apply to a shipment if sent pursuant to an airline interline agreement.
O. In the event that FedEx Office procures, accepts tender of, performs, or otherwise undertakes the transportation, delivery, or release of a package by FedEx, whether directly or indirectly, FedEx Office shall have the benefit of every right, defense, limitation, and liberty of whatsoever nature contained in these terms and conditions or otherwise available to FedEx as if such provision were expressly for its benefit.

## Delivery Signature Options

FedEx offers Delivery Signature Options for shippers. Not available for all shipments or to all destinations.
A. Indirect Signature Required. FedEx will obtain a signature in one of three ways:

1. From someone at the delivery address; or
2. From a neighbor, building manager, or other person at a neighboring address; or
3. Where available, the recipient can sign a FedEx door tag or utilize other FedExapproved means to authorize release of the package without anyone present. If delivery cannot be completed in these ways, FedEx may reattempt delivery.
B. Direct Signature Required. FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address. If no one is at the address, FedEx may reattempt delivery.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Delivery Signature Options, cont.)

C. Adult Signature Required. FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address who is at least the age of majority in the destination country. Government-issued photo identification or other identification customarily accepted by local authorities is required. In all cases, if there is no eligible recipient at the delivery address, FedEx may reattempt delivery.
D. Shipments to residential addresses may be released without obtaining a signature. If you require a signature for a residential shipment, select one of the Delivery Signature Options.
E. Choosing a Delivery Signature Option overrides a signature release.
F. FedEx will assess the delivery signature charge if the shipper requests the Delivery Signature Option, even if a signature is not obtained, the option requested is not available or FedEx is unable to provide a copy of the signature obtained at delivery.
G. Also see the Liabilities Not Assumed, Pickup and Delivery, and Routing and Rerouting sections.

## Dimensional weight (volumetric weight)

Dimensional-weight pricing is applicable on a per-shipment basis to all shipments in customer packaging. FedEx packaging may also be subject to dimensional-weight pricing. If the dimensional weight exceeds the actual weight, charges based on the dimensional weight will be assessed. Customers who fail to apply the dimensional-weight calculation to a package may be assessed dimensional-weight charges by FedEx. See the Dimensional Weight description in the Other Transportation-Related Fees and Shipping Information section of the FedEx Service Guide for additional details.

## Duties and taxes

A. In order to complete clearance of certain items through customs, FedEx may disburse duties and taxes as assessed by customs officials on behalf of the payer and assess a surcharge for doing so. For all shipments, FedEx may contact the payer and require confirmation of reimbursement arrangements as a condition to completion of clearance and delivery, and at our sole discretion, require payment of duties and taxes before release of the shipment to the recipient.
B. FedEx only provides estimates of customs duties and taxes through the Estimate Duties and Taxes feature on FedEx Global Trade Manager at fedex.com. Final duties and taxes may vary.
C. In the event the accuracy or propriety of duties and taxes assessed on a shipment is disputed, FedEx or its designated broker may review the shipping documents tendered with the shipment. If FedEx determines that the duties and taxes were properly assessed, the shipper agrees to pay the duties and taxes.
D. In the event we disburse duties, taxes, or other fees to a customs agency, including the U.S. Merchandise Processing Fee, on behalf of the payer, the payer will be assessed a clearance service fee based on a flat rate or a percentage of the total amount disbursed. This clearance service fee will vary depending upon the destination country.
E. If the sender fails to designate a payer on the air waybill, duties and taxes will automatically be billed to the recipient where allowed. Bill Sender Duties and Taxes and Bill Third Party Duties and Taxes are options available only for deliveries to specified locations (call FedEx International Customer Service at 1.800.463.3339 and say "international services").
F. REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, THE SENDER IS ULTRAVITELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT OF DUTIES AND TAXES AND ALL FEES AND SURCHARGES RELATED TO OUR DISBURSEMENT OF DUTIES AND TAXES IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED. If a recipient or a third party from whom reimbursement confirmation is required refuses to pay the duties and taxes upon request, we may contact the sender. If the sender refuses to make satisfactory arrangements to reimburse FedEx, the shipment may be returned to the sender (in which case, sender will be responsible both for original and return charges), or placed into a general order warehouse or a customs-bonded warehouse, or considered undeliverable.

If transportation charges for a shipment are billed to a credit card, FedEx reserves the right to also settle uncollected duties and taxes charges associated with that shipment to the credit card account.
G. If FedEx cannot obtain satisfactory confirmation of arrangements to reimburse it for amounts to be disbursed for duties and taxes, a shipment might be delayed. Such delays, or any other failure to comply with these conditions, constitute liabilities not assumed and are not service failures. Accordingly, they are not covered by the money-back guarantee. (See the Liabilities Not Assumed and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections.)
H. Payment for duties and taxes will be made by one of the following means at the sole discretion of FedEx: cash, check (personal or business, provided valid identification is
offered), credit card, money order, traveler's check, or debit or deferment account. FedEx does not accept prepayment of duties and taxes at the time of shipment.
I. We assume no responsibility for shipments abandoned in customs, and such shipments may be considered undeliverable.
J. In the event that we require confirmation of duties and taxes reimbursement arrangements from the recipient, we will attempt to contact the recipient no later than 12 p.m. on the day the shipment is available for customs clearance in the destination country and inform the recipient of the estimated duties and taxes amount. If an arrangement satisfactory to us is made, the shipment will then be cleared through customs and delivered. If the shipment clears customs by 5 p.m. on the day arrangements are confirmed, delivery will be scheduled for the next business day by 5 p.m. or the end of the local business day. In the event we have cleared packages on your behalf and you do not have credit arrangements with FedEx, payment may be required prior to the release of your shipment.

## Export control laws

FedEx is headquartered in the U.S. and will not transport shipments that violate U.S. export controls nor export controls in the countries in which we operate. You are responsible for, and warrant, your compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, and applicable export laws and regulations of any country to, from, through, or over which your shipment may be transported. You agree, and warrant, that you will comply with all applicable U.S. government territorial sanctions prohibiting the export or re-export of goods, services, or technology to or from countries and regions listed by the U.S. government unilaterally or in coordination with other countries' sanctions. In addition, no commodities originating or manufactured in countries and regions subject to territorial sanctions are accepted for transportation anywhere in the world. For a current list of FedEx countries and regions served see International Package Zones: U.S. Export and U.S. Import in the FedEx Service Guide.

Any FedEx Returns service shipments that are forwarded to a third country must also comply with the export control requirements of the country of first departure. You agree to furnish such information and complete and attach to the air waybill such documents as necessary to comply with such laws, rules, and regulations.

In addition, unless licensed or authorized by the relevant government agency or otherwise permitted under applicable laws, you specifically warrant that you will not tender any shipments to us if you or any of the parties involved in the shipment are listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State, the United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority. In addition, you agree and warrant that you will not attempt to ship to any entity owned by any party, in the common ownership interest determined by the relevant listing authority, subject to U.S. government economic sanctions.

Any shipments requiring a U.S. Department of State license or authorization, or requiring a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration export permit, and certain in-bond shipments, must be shipped using our FedEx International Controlled Export service option, only available with FedEx International Priority Express, FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Priority Freight, or FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution services. For further information, go to the FedEx International Controlled Export section on fedex.com/en-us/ shipping/services.html.

You agree to identify any shipments requiring any other U.S. government export license or permit, and shipments subject to such pre-export regulatory controls, and provide us with information and all necessary documentation to comply with the applicable U.S. laws and regulations. You are responsible at your expense for determining U.S. export licensing or permitting requirements for a shipment, obtaining any required U.S. export licenses or permits, and ensuring that the consignee is authorized as required by the applicable laws and regulations of the origin country, destination country, and any country(s) asserting jurisdiction over the goods. Further, you are responsible for ensuring that the end-use or end-user of the items shipped does not violate any specific control policies restricting certain types of exports, reexports, and transfers of specifically enumerated items subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.

We assume no liability to you or any other person for any loss or expense-including, but not limited to, fines and penalties, or the rejection, blocking, or destruction of your shipment-if you fail to comply with any export controls, sanctions, or customs laws, rules, or regulations.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## Extra-large packages

Extra-large packages are pieces weighing less than 151 lbs . (or destination country limit) that exceed 130 inches (or destination country limit) in length and girth combined. These pieces may be refused, or at our sole discretion may be considered as FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy Freight, or FedEx International Deferred Freight shipments once accepted by us. Dimensional-weight pricing is applicable on a per-shipment basis for extra-large packages. The chargeable weight is the greater of the actual weight or dimensional weight for extra-large packages and is applied on a per-shipment basis. The total shipment is subject to a minimum billable weight of 151 lbs . multiplied by the number of freight handling units.

## Fuel and other surcharges

We reserve the right to assess fuel and other surcharges on shipments without notice. The duration and amount of any surcharge will be determined at our sole discretion. By tendering your shipment to FedEx, you agree to pay the surcharges, as determined by FedEx. The fuel surcharge rate, if applicable, is available on fedex.com.

## Inspection of shipments and identification requirement

We may, at our sole discretion, open and inspect any shipment without notice. Governmental authorities may also open and inspect any shipment at any time. We may, at our sole discretion, require the shipper to provide their government-issued photo identification prior to tendering a package to FedEx.

## Liabilities not assumed

In no event shall FedEx, including, without limitation, agents, contractors, employees, and affiliates, be liable for any special, incidental, or consequential damages, including, without limitation, loss of profits or income, whether or not FedEx had knowledge that such damages might be incurred.

If we inadvertently accept a shipment with a destination city or cities that we do not serve in a country to which FedEx international services are provided, we may attempt to complete the delivery. However, we will not be liable and we will not provide any proof of delivery. The delivery commitment listed for such country will not apply, and the applicable rate will be the highest for that country plus the maximum extended service area surcharge. In these cases, the money-back guarantee applies only to the portion of the transportation provided directly by us.

We will not be liable or responsible for loss, damage, or delay caused by events we cannot control.

## Limitations on legal actions

In the event that the Montreal Convention or Warsaw Convention, as amended, does not prescribe limitations on legal actions, the following will apply.

Any right you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you file an action within one year from the date of delivery of the shipment or from the date on which the shipment should have been delivered.

Any right that you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, the periods and requirements for providing notice under the Billing, Claims, and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections. You and we understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must plead compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against us. You and we agree that FedEx cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until we wrongfully deny a claim submitted to us pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in these terms and conditions. Finally, you and we agree that you will comply with applicable notice periods and requirements even if you believe that such compliance will not result in relief from us or if you lack knowledge regarding whether such compliance will result in relief from us.

You agree that you will not sue us as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against us. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff.

To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to us.

The performance of any services does not make us an agent of the shipper or any third party for any purpose.

## Live animals

FedEx does not accept live-animal shipments as part of its regular-scheduled service and does not transport household pets such as dogs, cats, birds, and hamsters. FedEx may accept certain shipments of live animals such as horses, livestock, and zoo animals (to and from zoo locations only) on an exception basis if approved and coordinated by the FedEx Animal Desk (email animaldesk@fedex.com).

## Money-back guarantee policy

We offer a money-back guarantee for our services. ${ }^{1}$ This guarantee can be suspended, modified, or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.
A. Money-Back Guarantee. For U.S.-based payers, we will, at our option, and upon request, either refund or credit to the applicable invoice only your transportation charges if we deliver a shipment 60 seconds or more after the applicable delivery commitment. The money-back guarantee applies to shipments tendered using the following services: FedEx International First, FedEx International Next Flight, FedEx International Priority Express, FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy, FedEx International Economy Freight, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution Freight, FedEx International Premium, FedEx International Ground, and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments to Canada. This money-back guarantee is your exclusive remedy in the event of a service failure for the recovery of all or any portion of the FedEx charges for a shipment. If the money-back guarantee is suspended, there is no remedy or recovery of charges for a service failure. There are no delivery commitments for shipments on which the money-back guarantee is suspended.
B. Limitations. The following limitations apply:

1. Credits for transportation charges will be applied to the payer's account only, and refunds will be made payable to the payer only.
2. At the sole discretion of FedEx, the money-back guarantee may not be honored when the request is made by, or the information utilized to determine the status of the package is determined by, a third party other than the payer of the charges.
3. Only one refund or credit is permitted per package. In the case of multiple-piece shipments, this money-back guarantee applies to each package in the shipment. If a service failure occurs for any package within the shipment, a refund or credit will be given only for the portion of the transportation charges applicable to that package. For FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution Freight, and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments to Canada, the money-back guarantee is prorated based on the number and weight of packages within the shipment where delivery is not completed by the service commitment.
4. A credit or refund under our money-back guarantee policy will be applied only against charges for the shipment giving rise to the credit.
5. An exact delivery commitment time can be obtained only by telephoning International Customer Service and supplying us with all of the following:
6. Commodity being shipped
7. Date of the shipment
8. Exact destination
9. Weight of the shipment
10. Value of the shipment

Any transit time published in the FedEx Service Guide or elsewhere, or quoted by Customer Service without the above five required facts, is only an estimate and is not a stated delivery commitment time. You agree that our records regarding quoted delivery times will constitute conclusive proof of any such quotes.
6. If a delivery later than the original delivery commitment time is requested by the shipper or recipient before the first delivery attempt is made, the delivery commitment time for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be adjusted to account for the requested delivery date and/or time. However, the money-back guarantee may not apply to certain shipments for which the recipient has requested to modify or customize delivery through methods approved by FedEx.

Deliveries normally scheduled to be made on the day of holiday observance will be rescheduled for delivery on the next business day. The delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be extended for a period equal to the length of the holiday.
12. If the sender or recipient specifies a customs broker other than FedEx or the broker selected by FedEx (where this service is available), notification may be given to the broker by 12 p.m. on the first business day the shipment is available for customs clearance in the destination country, and such notification constitutes timely delivery.
13. For FedEx International Next Flight service, the quoted delivery time may be changed for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: flight delays or cancellations due to air traffic control, weather, or mechanical problems. If the delivery commitment is changed, the money-back guarantee will only be applicable to the latest quoted delivery time.
C. Exceptions. FedEx will not be obligated to refund or credit your transportation charges if:
14. We provide you with proof of timely delivery, consisting of the date and time of delivery and, if applicable, the name of the person who signed for the shipment, or service-exception information reflecting that the failure to deliver timely resulted from circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.
15. The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.

30. A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request. A notification of the reason for an unpaid charge with your payment is not considered a request for an invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request if the reason relates to a service failure.

## Package Consolidators (including FedEx Authorized ShipCenter ${ }^{\circledR}$ locations, and FedEx ShipSite ${ }^{\circledR}$ locations at Office Depot and OfficeMax)

FedEx cannot accept a consolidation under FedEx international services or FedEx International Broker Select from a Package Consolidator, unless the shipper:
a. Is a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter or FedEx ShipSite location, or
b. Ships using FedEx International Airport-to-Airport, or
c. Ships using FedEx International Express Freight, or
d. Ships using FedEx International Premium.

In addition, Package Consolidators are responsible for complying with all applicable requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, customs and other legal requirements applicable to packages tendered for international transportation.

If you tender packages to a Package Consolidator instead of to us directly, the following limitations apply:
A. Package Consolidators are not agents of FedEx, and we are not responsible for any errors or omissions made by them.
B. Package Consolidators may submit claims for refunds or credits for shipping charges under the money-back guarantee policy. Neither the person or entity tendering the package to the Package Consolidator nor the recipient is eligible for refunds or credits under the money-back guarantee policy.
C. In order for a Package Consolidator to receive packaging supplies from FedEx, the Package Consolidator must first enter into a Packaging and Pricing Agreement or a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter Agreement with FedEx.
D. Package Consolidators may charge FedEx ${ }^{\circledR}$ Retail Rates for FedEx shipping services, but they are not required to. Package Consolidators set their own rates for reselling FedEx services.
E. FedEx assumes no liability, other than to the Package Consolidator, for lost, damaged, or delayed shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator, as the Package Consolidator is the shipper of these packages. Package Consolidators are independently owned and operated businesses.
F. See the Package Consolidator representative for information regarding rates and services and the terms and conditions of carriage. Inquiries or claims regarding shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator must also be directed to the Package Consolidator. G. As directed by FedEx, Package Consolidators must require a government-issued photo ID to validate the identity of their customer and must keep a record of the name and address on the ID of their customer for each package.

## Package tracking/tracing

Tracing of international packages is available upon request. Call FedEx International Customer Service at 1.800.463.3339 (say "international services") and a tracing specialist will assist you. To trace your package, you must have all of the following information when you call us:
A. Air waybill number.
B. Date of shipment.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Package tracking/tracing, cont.)

C. Recipient's name and address.
D. Number of packages and total weight of shipment.
E. Contents and value of shipment.
F. Your name and phone number, so we can call you back.

## Packaging and marking

A. You must comply with all applicable laws (including, but not limited to, local, state, federal, and international laws), including those governing packing, marking, and labeling for all shipments.
B. It is the responsibility of the sender to properly complete the air waybill. The sender's address on an air waybill or electronic shipping device must show the country in which the shipment is tendered to FedEx.
C. All packages must be prepared and packed by the shipper for safe transportation with ordinary care in handling in an express-transportation environment. Any articles susceptible to damage as a result of conditions that may be encountered in transportation, such as changes in temperature or atmospheric pressure, must be adequately protected by proper packaging. FedEx assumes no liability for perishables or temperature-sensitive commodities that could be damaged by exposure to heat or cold. Each shipment must be legibly and durably marked with the name, address, and ZIP code/postal code of both the shipper and recipient. Packages cannot be wrapped in kraft paper.
D. You must use packaging in new or like-new condition. All packaging must be large enough to allow cushioning on top, bottom, and sides. Contents must be properly packaged to eliminate shifting.

To be in like-new condition:

- Packaging must not have any holes, tears, dents, or creases.
- Boxes must have no crushed corners.
- All previous shipping labels and barcodes must be covered or concealed.

All flaps, seams, and edges must be securely sealed with a minimum 2-inch-wide packing tape.

Items that cannot be packed into cartons (such as auto tail pipes, mufflers, tires, and rims) must have all sharp edges and protrusions wrapped, and the address label must be secured using the tie-on tag or the tire/crate label provided by FedEx (or you may secure it by wrapping pressure-sensitive tape completely around the object). Briefcases, luggage, garment bags, aluminum cases, plastic cases, computer cartons, or similar types of items whose outer finish might be damaged by adhesive labels, soiling, marking, or other types of surface damage that is normal with ordinary care in handling should be placed in a protective container for shipment. Casters, wheels, and rollers must be removed or packaged.
E. Expanded polystyrene foam coolers must be shipped inside a sturdy outer container unless tested and approved for acceptance by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing is available at fedex.com/en-us/shipping/packing.html. Expanded polystyrene foam coolers containing blood, urine, and other noninfectious liquid clinical specimens must be shipped inside a sturdy outer packaging.
F. FedEx does not recommend the use of wet ice (frozen water) as a refrigerant. Packages containing wet ice must be prepared to prevent the leakage of any liquid, regardless of package orientation. For additional wet-ice packaging requirements, refer to the packaging guide Packaging Perishable Shipments at fedex.com/en-us/shipping/packing.html.
G. If a shipment is refused by the recipient, leaks, or is damaged, the shipment will be returned to the sender if possible. If the sender refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage, or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment, and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage.
H. FedEx reserves the right to request a shipper to submit a representative sampling of the packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test the packaging, or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damages due to improper packaging.
I. FedEx may issue written notice to you if you repeatedly fail to adhere to FedEx's packaging requirements due to your pattern or practice of insufficient packaging. Claims for damage or loss associated with an identified pattern or practice of insufficient packaging will be denied. Any such claim filed related to your shipments will not be paid, regardless of which party files the claim, unless the claimant can establish that the loss or damage did not result from a failure to use proper packaging. FedEx will continue to deny such claims until we determine that you have ceased the pattern or practice of failing to adhere to the packaging requirements. Nothing in this
paragraph is intended to limit FedEx's right to deny a claim where the shipment in dispute is found to have improper packaging.
J. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing or evaluation, and tips on packaging specific commodities (including automotive and mechanical parts, computers, and perishables), are available at fedex.com/en-us/shipping/packing.html.
K. For international freight shipments, freight must be on a skid, pallet, or other forkliftable base. Boxes should be stacked squarely on the skid without hanging over the edge, and the weight should be distributed evenly on the skid to avoid excess weight being placed on materials inside the cartons. Use 70-gauge stretchwrap and pass a minimum of two bands (tightly secured) through the skid voids and around all cartons.
L. FedEx account holders may order supplies via fedex.com or by calling 1.800.463.3339 (say "order shipping supplies").

## Perishables or temperature-sensitive

Perishable or temperature-sensitive shipments contain contents that can be damaged by heat or cold. Common examples include but are not limited to food, medicines/supplements, plants, electronics, batteries, cosmetics, candles, and certain liquids. Shipments containing perishable or temperature-sensitive articles must be packaged for a minimum transit time of at least 24 hours greater than our delivery commitment time for the shipment. Shipping perishable articles over a weekend or holiday is discouraged, and packaging such shipments for longer transit times is required. We recommend that you ship perishable items via FedEx International First, FedEx International Priority Express, FedEx International Priority, or FedEx International Priority Freight; utilize service options such as Hold at Location to ensure packages are not left in outdoor conditions; and have your proposed packaging evaluated by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for evaluation is available at fedex.com/en-us/shipping/packing.html. Some perishables are prohibited from shipment (see the Prohibited Items section). FedEx International Ground and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments to Canada may not contain perishables (including, but limited to, perishable foodstuffs and foods and beverages; perishable pharmaceuticals; and any other items requiring refrigeration or other environmental control). For non-prohibited perishable shipments, your failure to use proper packaging releases us from any liability for spoiled perishables that we would otherwise assume (see the Liabilities Not Assumed section).

## Pharmaceuticals

Shipments of pharmaceuticals will only be accepted when tendered in accordance with applicable local, state, federal, and international laws. The shipper is responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. Controlled shipments moving under U.S. Drug Enforcement permits must be shipped using the FedEx International Controlled Export service option or FedEx air cargo services.

## Pickup and delivery

A. We provide delivery service at no additional charge to international destinations within primary service areas.
B. Agents are utilized for deliveries to points in extended service areas (ESAs). Depending on the final destination, an ESA surcharge per shipment may be applied for U.S. export shipments; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details. Please call FedEx International Customer Service to determine if your shipment will be subject to an ESA surcharge.
C. We do not offer a restricted-delivery service and may deliver to someone other than the person or entity named as the recipient. We also may make an indirect delivery. Indirect delivery is a completed delivery to an address or location other than the address on the air waybill. Package addresses must include the complete street address and telephone or telex number of the recipient.
D. Shipments to hotels, hospitals, government offices or installations, university campuses, or other facilities that utilize a mailroom or other central receiving area will be delivered to the central receiving area, unless otherwise authorized and approved by FedEx.
E. Any person scheduling a pickup other than the sender must provide a FedEx account number in good credit standing, otherwise the pickup must be scheduled by the sender. We require a minimum of two hours from the time the shipment(s) will be ready to make the pickup. (Contact FedEx International Customer Service for the specific lead times required.) Repeated pickup attempts without packages being ready may result in the cancellation of pickup privileges.
F. If we inadvertently accept a shipment with a destination city not served in a country to which FedEx International Priority Express or FedEx International Priority is provided, we may attempt to complete the delivery. However, certain limitations will apply. (See the Liabilities Not Assumed section.)
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Pickup and delivery, cont.)

G. FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy Freight, or FedEx International Deferred Freight shipments picked up or delivered to H3 areas will be picked up or delivered via cartage agents and a special handling fee will apply; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide. Freight pickup and delivery is not available on weekends (except in offshore locations where standard business days vary) for FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy Freight, and FedEx International Deferred Freight. H. Proof of pickup is available upon request. You must provide the pickup number or FedEx tracking number (also known as the air waybill number). We will not provide proof of pickup unless you provide this information.
I. At our sole discretion, we may refuse to pick up or deliver a shipment (package or freight), or use alternative pickup or delivery arrangements, to maintain the safety of our employees and in cases in which we believe that our services may be used in violation of local, state, federal, or international laws.
J. Additional charges may apply for late-hours, weekend, or holiday pickup and delivery. K. The delivery commitment for FedEx International Next Flight service will be the delivery time quoted to each customer. The quoted delivery time will vary for each shipment and will depend on the availability of suitable commercial airline flights.
A quoted delivery time may be changed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, flight delays or cancellations due to air traffic control, weather, or mechanical problems. In the event of the occurrence of any of the foregoing, the FedEx International Next Flight Service Desk shall quote a new delivery time to the shipper and recipient (if requested by the shipper) by telephone or by customer-reasonably-requested method; this new delivery time shall then become the quoted delivery time. Two attempts will be made to reach the shipper and two attempts to reach the recipient (if requested by the shipper). Any such change in the quoted delivery time will be logged in to the tracking system.
L. In order to facilitate delivery or release of a shipment, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, contact the recipient to obtain delivery instructions, or to notify them that a delivery is scheduled, that a delivery has been completed, or that a shipment is available for pickup at a Hold at Location facility. Where available, FedEx may also permit recipients to request modification or customization of delivery through methods approved by FedEx.
M. At its discretion, FedEx may not deliver or attempt delivery within the delivery commitment time of the service requested, if the shipper or recipient requested a later delivery or informed FedEx that the recipient is closed during the delivery commitment time. In this situation, charges will be assessed based on the service initially selected by the shipper. The shipper or payer is responsible for communicating with the recipient regarding requested later delivery times and is responsible for knowing the days and times that the recipient location can accept FedEx deliveries.
N. If a shipper tenders packages that substantially exceed the number, type, size, and/ or weight of packages tendered on average for the location by the shipper throughout the year, FedEx may accept such packages but, at its sole discretion, suspend the FedEx Money-Back Guarantee, if applicable, or adjust commitment times.
O. We reserve the right to assess a Residential Delivery surcharge on any shipment delivered to a home or private residence, including locations where a business is operated from a home, or on any shipment in which the shipper has designated the delivery address as a residence, including shipments where the delivery location has been designated as Residential Delivery in error.

## Post office box addresses

## Proof of performance (verbal)

When requested by the sender or recipient, verbal confirmation of delivery (date, time, and name of person who signed for the shipment) is available. For shipments to many countries that we serve, this information is usually available by 12 a.m. local time in the country of delivery on the day of scheduled delivery.

For FedEx International Next Flight service, a proof-of-delivery phone call to the shipper stating the date and time of delivery, and the name of the person who signed for the shipment will be performed for every shipment. Two attempts will be made to reach the shipper by telephone.

## Proof of performance (written)

When requested by the sender or recipient within one year of the shipping date, we will furnish electronically captured delivery information for deliveries made to most points served. A faxed proof of delivery will also be provided upon request by the shipper or the recipient.

Signature proof of delivery showing an image of the recipient's signature may be available online at fedex.com.

## Rate quotations

Rates and service quotations provided to you by FedEx, including, but not limited to, rates and service quotations provided by our employees, agents, interactive voice response systems, and customer automation platforms, are estimates and will be based upon information provided by you, but final rates and service charges may vary from the quotes based upon the characteristics of the shipment actually tendered to us and the application of these terms and conditions. We are not liable for, nor will any adjustment, refund or credit of any kind be made, as a result of any discrepancy in any rate or service quotation made prior to tender of the shipment and the rates, and other charges that we invoice to you. Any conflict or inconsistency between the FedEx Service Guide and other written or oral statements or quotes (except those found in a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement) concerning the rates, features of service, and terms and conditions applicable to FedEx service will be controlled by the FedEx Service Guide, as modified, amended, changed, or supplemented. FedEx only provides estimates of customs duties and taxes through the Estimate Duties and Taxes feature on FedEx Global Trade Manager at fedex.com.

Rates quoted will vary depending on whether (1) the shipper is a FedEx account holder and (2) the shipper has discounts applied to his or her account.
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Rate quotations, cont.)

- Shippers will be quoted FedEx Standard List Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, do not have discounts applied to their account, and if they charge their shipping to their account.
- Shippers will be quoted Account-Specific Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, have discounts applied to their account, and if they charge their shipping to their account.
- Shippers will be quoted FedEx Retail Rates for shipments originating in the U.S. that are paid for by cash, check, or debit or credit card instead of being charged to a valid FedEx account.


## Refusal or rejection of shipments

We reserve the right to refuse, hold, or return any shipment and may do so at our sole discretion and without liability to us. We will execute that right when (but not limited to cases in which): (1) the shipment may cause damage or delay to other shipments, property, or personnel; (2) the shipment is likely to sustain damage or loss in transit because of improper packaging or otherwise; (3) the shipment contains any prohibited items; (4) the account of the person or entity responsible for payment is not in good credit standing; (5) when acceptance of the shipment may jeopardize our ability to provide service to other customers; (6) when FedEx is unable to validate the identity of the shipper; or (7) when the shipper, recipient, or any of the parties involved are listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State; the United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority, unless licensed or authorized by the relevant government agency or otherwise permitted under applicable laws. We have no liability whatsoever for refusal or rejection of shipments.

Where required by law, including export controls, sanctions, and customs laws and regulations, FedEx may block or detain any shipment indefinitely and seek government authorization to return or destroy such shipment, and in such cases shall not be liable for any loss or damages that may result.

## Restrictions

A. Size restrictions vary by country.
B. Per-package weight limits may vary by country.
C. There is no limit on the aggregate weight of a multiple-piece shipment (except to Argentina), provided each individual package does not exceed the per-package weight limit for the destination country. Shipments exceeding 500 lbs. require advance arrangements with us. You must call us to arrange for pickup commitments and delivery commitments. The money-back guarantee will apply only once a delivery commitment has been established by FedEx after pickup of your shipment.
D. No more than one type of service may be indicated on a single air waybill and no more than one FedEx Envelope, FedEx 10kg Box, or FedEx 25 kg Box may be shipped on a single air waybill.
E. You may ship up to 10 different commodities on a single air waybill.
F. The declared value for carriage cannot exceed the declared value for customs as indicated on the air waybill.

## Return and import shipping options

Shipments returned to the United States using the FedEx Global Returns service option are governed by the terms and conditions applicable to the country from which the shipment is returned. Those terms and conditions of service may vary from country to country. Consult fedex.com/en-us/shipping/returns/global.html or our local office in the origin country for details.

Returns customers may use a currency other than U.S. dollars. Note that currency conversion rates may fluctuate. If a currency other than U.S. dollars is used, the U.S. returns party must check the current conversion rate to determine if an Electronic Export Information (EEI) is required to be filed. If a returns label is sent to the U.S., the U.S. returns party should always ensure that the Automated Export System (AES) proof of filing citation or Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) exemption statement is correctly printed on the label before exporting.

FOR FEDEX GLOBAL RETURNS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE PARTY THAT INITIATES A RETURN SHIPMENT TRANSACTION WITH FEDEX IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES AND ANY DUTIES OR TAXES WHICH WE HAVE DISBURSED, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE SENDER OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY.

Shipments initiated via the Create Import Shipment feature on fedex.com are governed by the terms and conditions applicable to the country from which the shipment originates. Those terms and conditions of service may vary from country to country. Consult our local office in the origin country for details.

FOR SHIPMENTS INITIATED VIA THE CREATE IMPORT SHIPMENT FEATURE ON FEDEX. COM, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE PARTY THAT INITIATES THE IMPORT SHIPMENT TRANSACTION WITH FEDEX IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES AND ANY DUTIES OR TAXES WHICH WE HAVE DISBURSED, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE SENDER OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY.

## Routing, rerouting, and address correction

We will determine the routing of all shipments. Some shipments may be consolidated or forwarded by FedEx for transportation on foreign air carriers, or on either a charter or an interline basis as FedEx may determine. We reserve the right to divert any shipment (including use of other carriers) in order to facilitate its delivery. At the sole discretion of FedEx, some or all of the transportation, handling, and/or service of FedEx shipments may be performed by other carriers as may be selected by FedEx. FedEx will charge the rate applicable to the FedEx service selected by the shipper at the time of tender. The features and services provided by such alternative carriers may differ from those provided by FedEx. In the event FedEx selects another carrier to perform any portion or all of the service selected by the shipper, the remaining terms (or features and services) of FedEx service will continue to be governed by the FedEx Terms and Conditions contained herein.

FedEx assumes no obligation to reroute any shipment to a third country, to carry the goods by any specified aircraft or over any particular route or to make connection at any point according to any schedules. You agree that FedEx may, without notice, substitute alternative carrier or aircraft, deviate from the route or routes, or cause the goods to be transported by motor vehicle.

FedEx may not reroute shipments when Adult Signature Required has been selected or applied as a delivery signature option.

Dangerous goods may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intendedrecipient's address provided by the shipper, unless dry ice is the only type of dangerous goods contained in the shipment. (Note: All dangerous goods shipments may be made available as hold for pickup at permissible locations or be returned to the sender.)

Any requested change to an address that is not a reroute or an address correction is a new shipment, and new shipping charges will apply.

THERE ARE NO STOPPING PLACES THAT ARE AGREED TO AT THE TIME OF THE TENDER OF THE SHIPMENT, AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ROUTE THE SHIPMENT IN ANY WAY WE DEEM APPROPRIATE.

Note: This section does not apply to requests for delivery to another address made by the recipient through methods approved by FedEx.

## Undeliverable shipments

An undeliverable shipment is one that cannot be delivered for reasons that include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

- The recipient refuses to pay for a bill-recipient shipment.
- The recipient refuses to accept the shipment prior to, during, or after delivery.
- The recipient's delivery address cannot be located.
- The shipment was addressed to an area not served by FedEx.
- The shipment's contents or packaging are damaged to the point that rewrapping is not possible.
- The shipment is unable to clear customs.
- The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel.

- The shipper, recipient, or any other party involved in the shipment is listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State; the
# FedEx Terms and Conditions 

International shipments (U.S. edition)

## (Undeliverable shipments, cont.)

United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority, and the shipment is not licensed or otherwise authorized by the relevant government agency.

- FedEx is unable to identify the shipper and/or recipient information.

Should a shipment be classified as undeliverable or unidentifiable, the following guidelines apply:
A. If a shipment is undeliverable for any reason, we may attempt to notify the sender to arrange for the return of the shipment if local customs regulations will allow. If the sender cannot be contacted within five business days, we may place the shipment in a general order warehouse or a customs-bonded warehouse or will dispose of the shipment. FedEx reserves the right, at its sole discretion, and without notice, to sell, destroy, or otherwise dispose of undeliverable shipments. By tendering a shipment, the shipper agrees to transfer and convey good and sufficient title of the contents of undeliverable shipments to FedEx, and agrees to pay any costs incurred in returning, storing, or in the sale, destruction, or disposal thereof.
B. For shipments returned from international points to the U.S., return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper, along with the original charges and fees. Also included will be any other charges incurred by us, including, but not limited to, duties, taxes, clearance service fees, and storage fees, if applicable. For returned shipments containing dangerous goods, the shipper must supply a completed return air waybill and all other required documents.
C. Shipments that cannot be returned due to local regulatory constraints will either be placed in a general order warehouse or a customs-bonded warehouse or disposed of at our sole discretion and at any location. The shipper agrees to pay any costs incurred by FedEx in such placement or disposal.

## FedEx International Connect Plus Supplemental Terms

In addition to the FedEx Terms and Conditions applicable to FedEx international services and service options, the following terms apply to the FedEx International Connect Plus ("FICP") service. In the event of a conflict between the FedEx Terms and Conditions and these FICP terms, the FICP terms take precedence.
A. The Money-Back Guarantee Policy does not apply to shipments tendered under the FICP service, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Shipper is not entitled to request Money-Back Guarantee for FICP shipments.
B. Where available, FedEx reserves the right to auto-redirect to hold (ARTH) any shipment to a location determined by FedEx (e.g., a retail pickup point location or locker alliance). In some destinations, ARTH will be made prior to any delivery attempt. When ARTH is utilized, the recipient will be made aware of the pickup location and other pickup information through a door tag or automated notice sent to his/her mobile device or email address. Where not prohibited by applicable law, Shipper shall provide FedEx with contact information (email address and mobile number) for the recipient so that FedEx may provide the recipient the option to use FedEx Delivery Manager ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ to manage the delivery of the shipment.
C. FICP is only available to select countries and territories. See fedex.com/en-us/ shipping/international/ecommerce-connect-plus.html for more information.

## Additional terms and conditions for FedEx International Ground and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments

In addition to the preceding terms and conditions, the additional terms and conditions below apply exclusively to FedEx International Ground and FedEx International Ground Consolidation shipments to Canada.
A. Billing:

1. Invoicing. Duties, taxes, clearance entry (brokerage) fees, and clearance service fees may be assessed on the contents of shipments destined for Canada. These are payable by the importer of record (normally the consignee, unless otherwise indicated) in the first instance. For FedEx International Ground brokerage-inclusive shipments, duties and taxes may be billed to the shipper, recipient, or third party. If a clearance entry fee applies, the payer of duties and taxes will be billed for the
clearance entry fee. Charges to the shipper's account in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars, using a weekly Wall Street Journal conversion rate corresponding to the pickup date of the shipment or, for FedEx International Ground Distribution, the date FedEx takes possession of the shipment. A service fee may apply. The clearance entry fee is subject to all applicable Canadian taxes.

Regardless of any payment instructions to the contrary, the shipper is ultimately liable for all charges and fees relating to a shipment, including, but not limited to, any duties or taxes that FedEx has disbursed. Shippers are responsible for accurately completing all sections of the required export documentation and for the entry of accurate shipment information (including, but not limited to, commodity descriptions and values for duty) on the Commercial Invoice and in any electronic device or software program.
2. Responsibility for Payment. The shipper is responsible for all charges, including transportation charges, duties, and clearance entry (brokerage) fees, clearance service fees, governmental penalties and fines, taxes, FedEx attorney fees, and legal costs related to this shipment, and charges related to broker unassigned shipments, or broker select shipments where the broker information provided is incorrect. The shipper will also be responsible for any cost FedEx may incur in returning shipments to the shipper or warehousing them, pending disposition.
B. Consolidation Service. Shippers utilizing FedEx International Ground Consolidation must meet all requirements as stated in the program-requirements document. By utilizing this consolidation service, the shipper agrees that:

1. Invoicing. FedEx will determine in its sole discretion which shipments will be consolidated or excluded from a consolidation.
2. FedEx is not liable for any increased brokerage costs associated with shipments that are not ultimately consolidated and clear customs as separate shipments. Any non-consolidated shipment may require a separate customs brokerage charge.
3. FedEx reserves the right to update program requirements and participant eligibility at any time.
4. All associated fees, limitations, and liabilities not assumed in these FedEx terms and conditions apply to any packages shipped under this program.
Please contact FedEx Customer Service at 1.800.463.3339 for more information.
C. Customs Clearance. Brokerage-inclusive service is the automatic default for FedEx International Ground service on FedEx electronic shipping solutions. In some instances, at the option of FedEx, FedEx may accept instructions from the importer of record to use a designated customs broker other than the broker arranged by FedEx or the broker designated by the shipper. In this case, the shipment will no longer be considered a brokerage-inclusive shipment.

When FedEx arranges clearance services, a clearance entry fee will be added as a clearance service fee to the duty-and-tax invoice to cover processes required to check the Commercial Invoice submitted with the shipment and to complete entry preparation procedures required by either U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the Canada Border Services Agency, including calculation of applicable duties and taxes for each type of commodity included in the shipment.

1. U.S. Export Shipments. FedEx is headquartered in the U.S. and will not transport shipments that violate U.S. export controls nor export controls in the countries in which we operate, provided they do not conflict with U.S. law. You are responsible for, and warrant, your compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, and applicable export laws and regulations of any country to, from, through, or over which your shipment may be transported. You agree, and warrant, that you will comply with all applicable U.S. government sanctions prohibiting the export or re-export of goods, services, or technology to countries and regions listed by the U.S. government unilaterally or in coordination with other countries' sanctions. In addition, no commodities originating or manufactured in any of these countries and regions are accepted for transportation anywhere in the world.

Any FedEx Returns service shipments that are forwarded to a third country must also comply with the export control requirements of the country of first departure. You agree to furnish such information and complete and attach to the shipment such documents as necessary to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.

In addition, you specifically warrant that you will not tender any shipments to us if you or any of the parties involved in the shipment are listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department

In addition, you agree and warrant that you will not attempt to ship to any entity owned by any party, in the common ownership interest determined by the relevant listing authority, subject to U.S. government economic sanctions. Further, you are responsible for ensuring that the end-use or end-user of the items shipped does not violate any specific control policies restricting certain types of exports, reexports, and transfers of specifically enumerated items subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.

We assume no liability to you or any other person for any loss or expense including, but not limited to, fines and penalties - if you fail to comply with any export laws, rules, or regulations.

Shipments crossing borders must be cleared through customs before being delivered to the consignee. You are responsible for providing FedEx with the importer of record's customs broker. This can be done by entering broker information on the Commercial Invoice or by selecting the broker select option and entering broker information in the automation device. If the importer of record is self-clearing the shipment through customs, you must specifically indicate that on the shipment documentation or clearance fees may apply.

The shipper agrees to provide all required documentation for the customs clearance and certifies that all statements and information on said documentation, including documentation submitted electronically, are true and correct. The shipper authorizes FedEx to forward all information of any nature regarding shipments to any and all governmental or regulatory agencies that request or require such information. The shipper understands that making false declarations or statements may result in civil and criminal penalties, including forfeiture and sale.

If the shipper does not complete all documents required for carriage, or if the documents submitted are not appropriate for the services or destinations specified, the shipper hereby authorizes FedEx, where permitted by law, to complete, correct, or replace the documents for the shipper at the shipper's expense. However, FedEx is not obligated to do so.

If a substitute form of Commercial Invoice is needed to complete delivery of the shipment, and FedEx completes such a document, these terms and conditions will continue to govern.

When shipments are held by customs or other agencies because of incorrect or missing documentation, FedEx may attempt to notify the consignee or shipper, as determined by local law. If the consignee or shipper fails to supply the required information or documentation, the shipment may be determined to be undeliverable. FedEx assumes no responsibility for the inability to complete a delivery due to incorrect or missing documentation. Shipments held by customs or other agencies because of incorrect or missing documentation will require additional transit time.
2. U.S. Import Shipments. Shipments originating outside the U.S. for delivery in the U.S. are subject to local tariffs and these service conditions including terms regarding the importation and customs clearance of shipments into the U.S. from Canada.
U.S. Customs regulations require the Social Security Number (SSN) of an individual and the Internal Revenue Service Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the U.S. consignee for certain shipments being imported into the U.S. This information must be included on the Commercial Invoice for all U.S. import shipments. The EIN or SSN must be on file with the U.S. Customs Service. Any changes to a company address, or the EIN or SSN, should be provided to FedEx for
system updating. Shipments that arrive in the U.S. that do not have the correct EIN or SSN may be detained until that information can be obtained from the consignee or determined otherwise. This requirement applies to shipments imported to the U.S. requiring a formal entry.
D. Duties and Taxes. In order to expedite customs clearance, FedEx may elect to disburse duties and taxes on the importer's behalf. A FedEx agent or employee may contact the importer to confirm arrangements for reimbursement of amounts to be disbursed. For brokerage-inclusive shipments, duties, and taxes may generally be billed to the shipper, consignee, or third party as designated on the Commercial Invoice or entered in an automation device.
E. Inspection of Shipments and Identification Requirement. FedEx, or its agents or brokers, may open and inspect any or all packages in a shipment at any time. This action may be initiated by FedEx or at the request of government authorities. We may, at our sole discretion, require the shipper to provide their government-issued photo identification prior to tendering a package to FedEx.
F. Northern Canada Surcharge. Canada packages destined to the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Labrador are restricted to a maximum 70-lb. weight limit and will incur an additional charge. Packages weighing more than 70 lbs. may be refused or returned to the shipper. However, at our sole discretion, they may be accepted and delivered for an additional charge. These additional charges apply to postal codes A0K, A0P-A0R, A2V, and XDA-19Z. The charges are in addition to applicable transportation charges.
G. Postal Codes and Telephone Numbers. The consignee's postal code, telephone number, and contact name are critical information and should be included on both the Commercial Invoice and address label.
H. Shipper Warranty. The shipper warrants that each article in each shipment will possess the required paperwork to export, will be properly described on the Commercial Invoice, will be acceptable for transport by FedEx, and will be properly marked, addressed, and packaged to ensure safe transportation with ordinary care in handling.
I. Undeliverable Shipments. The shipper may elect to have a shipment returned if the shipment is refused by the consignee or for any other reason cannot be delivered. If a shipment is returned to the shipper, the shipper is responsible for payment of both the original transportation charges and the return charges. All duties and taxes, assessed in the destination country as well as the origin country upon return, are also the responsibility of the shipper. All return charges are payable immediately upon request.

A shipper may elect to "abandon" the shipment in the destination country. If a shipment is abandoned, FedEx, at its discretion, reserves the right to dispose of the merchandise. The shipper will be responsible for any charges associated with disposal.
