# Special Packaging Needs 

## PACKAGE

If you ship the following items, consider their special packaging needs.

## Batteries

A variety of batteries are regulated as hazardous materials by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and International Air Transport Association (IATA). For assistance in determining whether or not your battery shipment is regulated, please call the DOT's Hazardous Materials Info-line at 1-800-467-4922. Batteries requiring shipping papers may only be tendered by contract hazmat shippers. (See the "UPS® Guide for Shipping Ground and Air Hazardous Materials" at ups.com/hazmat.)
Any device with batteries installed must have its on/off switch protected from being activated or have the batteries removed with the terminals protected. Simple devices like flashlights or rechargeable drills can generate a dangerous amount of heat if accidentally activated. Electronic items sent for repair, such as computers and cell phones, should be sent without batteries. For additional information regarding the shipment of batteries and current lithium battery regulations, please refer to ups.com/batteries.

## Bundled or Strapped Boxes

Only same-sized boxes may be strapped together. Use a minimum of four crisscrossed bands, two in each direction. An address label must be placed on each box. When strapping boxes together, each box must be strong enough to hold the total weight of the strapped bundle.
For example, if two 15-pound boxes are banded together into a 30-pound package, both components should be in boxes with at least a 30-pound weight capacity. An Additional Handling charge may apply. Refer to page 127 for more information.

## Electronic Media

To ship electronic media that contain sensitive personal information (such as personal, financial or health information), we recommend that you do not use an envelope, letter packaging, UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelope, UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelope - Reusable, UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Pak or UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Pad Pak. UPS provides special packaging, the UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Hard Pak - Secure, which is designed to help you ship sensitive electronic media. Call 1-800-PICK-UPS ${ }^{\circledR}(1-800-742-5877)$ or your sales representative for more information.

You can also ship electronic media containing sensitive personal information by packaging it with a duplicate shipping label in an inner container that can be securely sealed. Place the inner container in a new outer corrugated box. Seal all flaps securely. Prior to packaging, mark the electronic media with identifiable information, such as your company name, reference number or your UPS shipping number. Additionally, the shipper should retain a copy of the data and secure the data on the electronic media through encryption or other technological means.
# Special Packaging Needs 

## Fabric and Wallpaper

Rolled goods travel best when shipped in corrugated boxes. If a fabric or wallpaper roll is shipped in a bag, UPS recommends a bag with a minimum thickness of six mils. Make sure the bag is tightly wrapped and taped against the roll to reduce the risk of tearing. A tail on an item shipped in a bag must be compressed to the body of the item using tape.
Place the address label on a flat surface of the item being shipped. Place duplicate address labels inside cores or between top layers of material. An Additional Handling charge may apply. Refer to page 127 for more information.

## Irregularly Shaped Items and Bare Metals

Tape the address label on a flat surface of the item being shipped. Cover the label with clear tape. Do not use "flying tags" attached by string or metal. Blunt all sharp or protruding edges with taped-on, corrugated cardboard pieces. Protect the surface of the item as needed. An Additional Handling charge will apply. Refer to page 127 for more information.

## Large and/or Heavy Packages

Packaging materials need to be evaluated carefully for packages weighing more than 70 pounds.
A UPS Heavy Package sticker is required whenever you ship packages weighing more than 70 pounds. Place the sticker to the right of the address label and write the package's weight in the white box. It also helps to highlight every side of your package with Heavy Package highlight tape. This sends a warning to those who risk lifting your package, both your employees and ours.
Customers with a UPS account can request supplies, free of charge. Order Supplies and Forms by visiting ups.com. Refer to the Large Package Surcharge on page 129 for fees.

## Tires

Apply a wide band of pressure-sensitive tape through the center and completely around the body of the tire so that the tape is attached to itself. Attach your address label to the tape band where it covers the tread. Cover the entire label with clear tape. An Additional Handling charge will apply. Refer to page 127 for more information.

## Palletizing Your Shipment

Pallets are portable rigid platforms used to consolidate shipments and allow for ease of freight movement. Quality pallets are commonly made of either wood or plastic and can weigh between 20 and 70 pounds. Pallets should be large enough to accommodate the shipment without

## Step by Step

The following are basic step-by-step instructions for palletizing your freight shipments.

## 1. Select Pallets.

- Choose pallets large enough to prevent overhang of shipment pieces
- Pallets must be sturdy enough to support the load
- Select pallets with closely spaced pallet deck boards
- Never exceed the rated capacity of your pallet
- Do not select pallets with broken boards or protruding nail heads

Air Freight and UPS Worldwide Expedited Ground Freight
Air Freight and UPS Worldwide Expedited Ground Freight shipments can include combinations of palletized items or boxes that are too large to ship using other UPS services. They can also include multiple non-palletized pieces. UPS will accept freight shipments of any weight; however, minimum weight charges may apply. Pre-authorization is required for Air Freight and UPS Worldwide Expedited Ground Freight shipments that exceed 120 inches in length, 84 inches in width, 76 inches in height or 5,000 pounds in weight.
overhang. Anything overhanging the pallet edges may be damaged from punctures, abrasions and compression.

## Palletizing Your Shipment

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

- Pallets with four-way forklift entry are preferred as they help to improve handling and reduce damage to the shipment

2. Stack boxes on Pallet.

For shipments that contain boxes or stackable pieces:

- Ensure cartons are new and of proper strength to withstand stacking
# Packaging Guidelines 

UPS WORLDWIDE EXPRESS FREIGHT ${ }^{\circledR}$ MIDDAY, UPS WORLDWIDE EXPRESS FREIGHT, ${ }^{\circledR}$ UPS WORLDWIDE EXPEDITED ${ }^{\circledR}$ GROUND FREIGHT AND AIR FREIGHT

## Step by Step (continued)

- Securely close, staple and/or seal cartons
- Protect product from internal vibration with proper amounts of dunnage within cartons; no void areas/spaces between product or on top of carton
- Remove old labels from shipping cartons and product
- Affix labels, with complete address information for the shipper and the consignee, to each piece
- Align boxes in columns, corner to corner, for the greatest stacking strength
- Avoid interlocking or rotating layer patterns
- Do not align corners over the spaces between pallet deck boards
- Boxes should not extend past the pallet edges
- Do not pyramid the boxes; keep the top layer flat to prevent damage from top loads
- Use a slip sheet under the load and every third layer when possible to help distribute the weight evenly and protect the bottom layer

3. Secure Shipment to Pallet.

- Use a minimum 60-gauge stretch wrap, five revolutions recommended; tie to pallet and across top to prevent shifting
- For Air Freight and UPS Worldwide Expedited Ground Freight, label all handling units with shipper/consignee information and PRO Numbers (at minimum all four vertical sides, interior and exterior of the stretch wrapping); use markers if having adhesion issues
- To ensure stability, corner boards and banding are recommended
- Use three-way locking, nailed corners (not staples) on crates; angle board must extend from the deck board to the top of the pallet load
- Insert layers of cardboard between layers of freight to absorb vibration; distribute the weight evenly


## 4. Label Shipment.

- For UPS Worldwide Express Freight Midday and UPS Worldwide Express Freight shipments, apply labels to each side of the pallet and on top of the pallet-each label should have telephone numbers and complete address information, including postal code of the shipper and the consignee
- For Air Freight and UPS Worldwide Expedited Ground Freight, label each pallet with telephone numbers and complete address information, including postal code of the shipper and the consignee
- Ensure information on the Bill of Lading (BOL) matches the shipment
- Indicate in proper location on the BOL and check contract/tariff for liability limits if excess declared value is needed
- Do not pyramid, ship or accept prohibited items or freight that overhangs the pallet


## Protecting Your Palletized Shipment from Damage

| Solution | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Corner/Edge Boards | - Increase vertical stacking strength, prevent damage to corner edges and stabilize the load |
|  | - Should extend to the full height and length of the load and should be used on all corners |
| Strapping or Banding | - Prevents pieces from getting lost or separated from the load |
|  | - Should be drawn tightly to the load, possibly requiring running it underneath the top deck boards <br> of the pallet |
| Stretch Wrapping | - Use as an effective way to keep all pieces of a shipment together |
|  | - Should first be applied around the pallet and continued upward around the load |
|  | - Must be tight to prevent load shifting |
|  | - Capture the pallet when wrapping bottom layer |
|  | - Designed to stabilize the load, not to secure it to the pallet |
|  | - Strapping or banding should be used in conjunction with stretch wrap to secure the load to the pallet |
| Top/Bottom Load Protector | - Layers of corrugated fiberboard or heavy paperboard |
|  | - Use to help evenly distribute the weight of shipments that can be stacked upon one another |

Note: UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ Services do not accept non-palletized freight shipments.
# Determine the Weight and Size 

## PACKAGE

## For All Domestic and International Shipments

The "Determine the Weight and Size" information on this page and the next applies to package shipments only. For information on how to determine the weight and size for UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ Midday and UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ shipments, refer to page 20. For information on how to determine the weight and size for UPS ${ }^{\text {a }}$ Simple Rate shipments, refer to page 74 .

Shipping rates are based on package weight and size (explained below and on the following page) and origin-todestination distance (refer to page $\underline{29}$ for Domestic, Export and Import).

Billable weight is the weight used to calculate the rate. For domestic and international services, the billable weight will be the greater of the dimensional weight compared to the actual weight.

How to determine billable weight: 1. Determine actual weight.

Actual weight is the package weight rounded up to the next whole pound.

Use a scale to determine the weight of the package. Round any fraction of a pound to the next whole pound for UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelopes (letters) over eight ounces and all other packages.
2. Determine dimensional weight. Dimensional weight reflects package density, which is the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight. Dimensional weight may apply to all UPS domestic and international package services.
Determine the package dimensions in inches. For each dimension, measure at the longest point, rounding each measurement to the nearest whole number (for example, 1.00 to 1.49 will be considered 1 , and 1.50 to 1.99 will be considered 2). The minimum measurement for each dimension is 1 inch.
Multiply the package length (longest side of the package) by the width by the height. The result is the cubic size in inches.

Divide the cubic size in inches by 139 to determine the dimensional weight in pounds. Increase any fraction to the next whole pound.
3. Determine billable weight. Compare the package's actual weight to its dimensional weight. The greater of the two is the billable weight and should be used to calculate the rate.
For multiple-package shipments eligible for shipment pricing, total the billable weight of all packages in the shipment.

## Dimensional Weight Calculation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Dimensional Weight } \\
& \text { in Pounds }

# Determine the Weight and Size 

## PACKAGE

## For All Domestic and International Shipments (continued)

## Additional Information on Determining Weight and Size.

- Letter rates apply for domestic and international documents, correspondence and electronic media shipments that do not exceed eight ounces sent in a UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelope. Domestic Letters greater than eight ounces will be billed by weight (rounded up to the next whole pound). Export Letters greater than eight ounces and up to two pounds will be billed at UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Pak rates. Export Letters greater than two pounds and import Letters greater than eight ounces will be billed by weight (rounded up to the next whole pound).
- UPS Express Pak rates apply for export shipments that weigh two pounds or less, do not exceed $\$ 100.00$ in customs value and UPS Express Pak is selected at the time of shipping.


## - Irregularly Shaped Packages:

If the package has a bulge or is irregularly shaped, measure the length, width and height of the package at its extreme points, which may include the bulge or irregular aspects of the package.
Treat the irregularly shaped package as if it were in a regular rectangular box. Measure the length, width and height of the package from its extreme points.
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

- Items Shipped in Bags:

Shape - When multiple items are shipped in a flexible container (e.g., burlap or plastic bag), the package measurements will be determined when the exterior is at rest. As this shape will differ from placement to placement, cubic size or package measurements will be made at the sole discretion of UPS.
Tails - A tail on an item shipped in a bag should be measured for the amount of space it takes up in a reasonably compressed fashion. Any tail that is created by placing an item in a bag must be compressed and taped to the body of the item.

- Packages that exceed UPS weight and size limits are not accepted for transportation. If found in the UPS system, they are subject to an Over Maximum Limits charge. UPS reserves the right in its sole and unlimited discretion to return such packages to the shipper at the shipper's expense. Refer to page 129 for more information. For Maximum Weight service restrictions, refer to page 8. For shipments over 150 pounds other than UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ Services, refer to pages 76-77 for Air Freight, page 6 for Coyote Logistics ${ }^{\circledR}$ Truckload and page 15 for UPS Worldwide Expedited ${ }^{\circledR}$ Ground Freight for more information.
- A Large Package Surcharge may apply to domestic and international shipments.
For domestic shipments, a package is considered a "Large Package" when its length (longest side of the package)
plus girth $[(2 \times$ width $)+(2 \times$ height $)]$ combined exceeds 130 inches or its length exceeds 96 inches.
For international shipments, a package is considered a "Large Package" when its length (longest side of the package) plus girth [ $(2 \times$ width) $+(2 \times$ height $)]$ combined exceeds 130 inches.
Large Packages are subject to a minimum billable weight of 90 pounds. See page 129 for applicable rates. An Additional Handling charge will not be assessed when a Large Package Surcharge is applied.
- Shippers are responsible for providing accurate and complete shipment information on the shipping document or in the automated processing system used, including service selected, number, weight and dimensions of packages. UPS reserves the right to audit any package and/or invoice to verify service selection, package dimensions or weight and applicability of any charges. As part of that audit, UPS may weigh and measure any package tendered to UPS using any method UPS deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, multidimensional measuring devices. If any aspect of the shipment information provided by the shipper is incomplete or incorrect as determined by UPS in its sole and unlimited discretion, UPS may in its sole and unlimited discretion adjust charges at any time.

Follow the instructions on this page and the previous page to determine the billable weight for your package shipments. Refer to page 20 for UPS Worldwide Express Freight Services.

## Notes:

- Size limits indicated by a box manufacturer may not reflect exterior dimensions of a package, including where a package may have bulges or otherwise may not be uniform across each plane, and should not be used as a substitute for actual length, width and height measurements in determining dimensional weight.
- Improper packaging may result in the alteration of a package's dimensions during transit, which can affect the package's dimensional weight and result in a shipping charge correction.

## Determine the Weight and Size

UPS WORLDWIDE EXPRESS FREIGHT ${ }^{\circledR}$ MIDDAY AND UPS WORLDWIDE EXPRESS FREIGHT ${ }^{\circledR}$

## For International Palletized Shipments

Shipping rates are based on the shipment weight, including the weight of the pallet and size and origin-todestination distance (refer to page 29 for Export and Import).

Billable weight is the weight used to calculate the rate. The billable weight will be the greater of the dimensional weight as compared to the actual weight.

How to determine billable weight: 1. Determine actual weight.

Actual weight is the weight of the items on the pallet and the weight of the pallet, rounded up to the next whole pound.

Use a scale to determine the weight. Round any fraction of a pound to the next whole pound.
2. Determine dimensional weight. Dimensional weight reflects pallet density, which is the amount of space a pallet occupies in relation to its actual weight. Dimensional weight may apply to all UPS Worldwide Express Freight Midday or UPS Worldwide Express Freight shipments.

Determine the pallet dimensions in inches. For each dimension, measure at the longest point, rounding each measurement to the nearest whole number (for example, 1.00 to 1.49 will be considered 1 , and 1.50 to 1.99 will be considered 2). The minimum measurement for each dimension is 1 inch.

Multiply the pallet length by the width and by the height. The result is the cubic size in inches.

For export and import shipments, divide the cubic size in inches by 139 to determine the dimensional weight. Increase any fraction to the next whole pound.
3. Determine billable weight. Compare the pallet's actual weight to its dimensional weight. The greater of the two is the billable weight and should be used to calculate the rate.

## Additional Information on Determining Size and Weight.

- Pallets that exceed maximum size or weight restrictions (which vary by origin and destination) as set forth at ups.com/assets/ resources/media/wwef_max_dim. pdf require prior approval, and are subject to an Oversize Pallet Handling Surcharge. Refer to page 129 for more information.

*The minimum billable shipment weight applies to all Air Freight services within and between the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. For UPS Worldwide Expedited Ground Freight, use minimum weight per shipment as defined above. For UPS Air Freight Direct ${ }^{\circledR}$ and UPS Air Freight Consolidated ${ }^{\circledR}$ services, a minimum shipment dollar amount is applied. Refer to the "UPS Air Freight Terms and Conditions of Contract for UPS Air Freight Services in the United States, Canada and International" at UPS Supply Chain Solutions, ups.com/freighttermsafservice or call 1-800-443-6379.
2. Determine actual weight and round up any fraction of a pound or kilogram to the next whole pound or kilogram.
3. Determine dimensional weight.

For each dimension, measure at the longest point, rounding each measurement to the nearest whole number. The minimum measurement for each dimension is 1 inch. Multiply the shipment length by the width by the height. The result is the cubic size. Divide the cubic size by the dimensional weight factor located in the matrix below to determine the dimensional weight.

| Service | Origin | Destination | Dimensional Weight Factor (inches/Pounds) | Dimensional Weight Factor (centimeters/Kilograms) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| UPS ${ }^{\oplus}$ Air Freight Premium Direct | All | All | 139 | 5,000 |

## Determining the UPS Simple Rate Package Size

1. Package the item in a box or poly mailer.
UPS Simple Rate is designed to be used with the shipper's own box or poly mailer.
2. Measure the package dimensions in inches.
For each dimension, measure at the longest point, rounding each measurement to the nearest whole number (for example, 1.00 to 1.49 will be considered 1 , and 1.50 to 1.99 will be considered 2). The minimum measurement for each dimension is 1 inch.
3. Calculate the package size in cubic inches.
Multiply the package length (longest side of the package) by the width by the height. The result is the size in cubic inches.
4. Determine the package's UPS Simple Rate size.
Determine the UPS Simple Rate size, according to the package's size in cubic inches, using the chart below.

## Shipment Pricing

## UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ Midday, UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ UPS Worldwide Saver ${ }^{\circledR}$ UPS Worldwide Expedited ${ }^{\circledR}$ and UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Standard

Shipment pricing is advantageous because rates are based on the total weight of a shipment, not the sum of the rates for each package in a shipment.

## What Qualifies

1. The shipment consists of multiple packages, using the same service, shipped on the same day to a single consignee.
2. For shipments processed with WorldShip ${ }^{\circledR}$ or UPS CampusShip ${ }^{\circledR}$ shipping systems, ups.com shipping, the UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Developer Kit or a UPS Ready ${ }^{\circledR}$ solution that supports full international service, or a UPS Worldwide Services Waybill. Note: For shipments processed with UPS Developer Kit - Shipping API, in order to obtain the best rate, customers are responsible for aggregating shipments for shipment pricing prior to requesting labels (UPS Developer Kit Shipping API does not run End of Day).

## What Does Not Qualify

Shipment pricing does not apply to UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelopes, UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Paks, the UPS ${ }^{\circledR} 10$ KG Box, the UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ 25 KG Box or packages recorded in a UPS Shipping Record book; they are each considered separate shipments.

## Rates

Rates are based on the total billable weight of all packages in the shipment. Compare each package's actual weight to its dimensional weight. The greater of the two is the billable weight and should be used to calculate the rate. For multiple-package shipments, total the billable weight of all packages in the shipment. Refer to pages 18-19 for instructions on calculating dimensional and billable weight.

If the payer of the shipping charges is located in the origin country, the shipment will be charged the export rate (Origin Country Export Rates). When the payer of the shipping charges is located in the destination country,
the shipment will be charged the import rate (Destination Country Import Rates). If the destination country does not have import rates, the shipment will be charged the export rate (Origin Country Export Rates). When the payer of the shipping charges is located in a third country (neither origin nor destination country), the shipment will be charged the Origin Country Export Rates, except as otherwise agreed to by UPS and the contracting party.

For shipments weighing 150 pounds or less, locate the rate for the total weight of the shipment on the appropriate rate chart.

For shipments weighing more than 150 pounds, multiply the total weight (rounded to the next whole pound) by the appropriate price per pound. The amount billed will be the result of this calculation or the minimum rate shown, whichever is greater.

For a multiple-package UPS Standard shipment, the minimum charge will be based on an average weight of 15 pounds per package.

## Customs Brokerage

For UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Express Freight Midday, UPS Worldwide Express Freight, UPS Worldwide Saver, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Standard to Mexico, rates include routine, in-house customs clearance by UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Additional charges will apply if customs clearance is performed by customs brokerage offices other than those designated by UPS for clearing the services listed above.

Customs clearance for the services listed is provided by the UPS Supply Chain Solutions customs brokerage offices designated by UPS for handling package customs clearance. Other UPS Supply Chain Solutions customs brokerage offices charge fees for clearance of packages and freight.

For UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Standard to Canada, charges for customs clearance are not included in the rate. UPS will provide Customs Brokerage Services, unless otherwise specified by the importer. Customs brokerage charges, duties and taxes will be billed to the importer, unless otherwise indicated by the shipper. Canada brokerage rates are available at ups.com/cacustomsclearance.

## Shipment Pricing

## UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Express NA1, UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ Midday, UPS Worldwide Express Freight ${ }^{\circledR}$ UPS Worldwide Saver, UPS Worldwide Expedited, UPS 3 Day Select ${ }^{\circledR}$ from Canada and UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Standard

Shipment pricing is advantageous because rates are based on the total weight of a shipment, not the sum of the rates for each package in a shipment.

## What Qualifies

1. The shipment consists of multiple packages, using the same service, shipped on the same day to a single consignee.
2. For shipments processed with WorldShip ${ }^{\circledR}$ or UPS CampusShip ${ }^{\circledR}$ shipping systems, ups.com shipping, the UPS ${ }^{\circledR}$ Developer Kit or a UPS Ready ${ }^{\circledR}$ solution that supports full international service or a UPS Worldwide Services Waybill. Note: For shipments processed with UPS Developer Kit - Shipping API, in order to obtain the best rate, customers are responsible for aggregating shipments for shipment pricing prior to requesting labels (UPS Developer Kit Shipping API does not run End of Day).

## What Does Not Qualify

Shipment pricing does not apply to UPS Express ${ }^{\circledR}$ Envelopes, the UPS ${ }^{\circledR} 10$ KG Box or the UPS ${ }^{\circledR} 25$ KG Box; they are each considered separate shipments.

## Rates

Rates are based on the total billable weight of all packages in the shipment. Compare each package's actual weight to its dimensional weight. The greater of the two is the billable weight and should be used to calculate the rate. For multiple-package shipments, total the billable weight of all packages in the shipment. Refer to pages 18-19 for instructions on calculating dimensional weight.

If the payer of the shipping charges is located in the origin country, the shipment will be charged the export rate (Origin Country Export Rates). When
the payer of the shipping charges is located in the destination country, the shipment will be charged the import rate (Destination Country Import Rates). If the destination country does not have import rates, the shipment will be charged the export rate (Origin Country Export Rates). When the payer of the shipping charges is located in a third country (neither origin nor destination country), the shipment will be charged the Origin Country Export Rates, except as otherwise agreed to by UPS and the contracting party.

Unless otherwise specified at the time of shipping, shipping charges are billed to the shipper. In the event of nonpayment by consignee or third party, the charges are billed to the shipper. Refer to pages 147-149 for more information on billing options.

For shipments weighing 150 pounds or less, locate the rate for the total weight of the shipment on the appropriate rate chart.

To determine the rate for a shipment weighing more than 150 pounds, multiply the total weight (rounded to the next whole pound) by the appropriate price per pound as shown under the shipment weight designations above 150 pounds.
